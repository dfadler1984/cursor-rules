## Capabilities

- Guide safe refactors (pure extraction, rename, reorganization)
- Preserve behavior with tests; prefer functional seams and immutability

## Triggers & Routing

- Verbs: refactor|extract|rename|reorganize
- Attach testing + tdd-first to ensure behavior parity

## Inputs â†’ Outputs

- Inputs: target modules/functions and goals
- Outputs: refactored code plan and minimal, behavior-preserving edits

## Constraints & Guards

- Avoid cross-cutting changes; prefer small, isolated steps
- Run focused tests before/after; keep diffs scoped

## Examples

- "Extract parse logic to utils/parse.ts with pure API"
