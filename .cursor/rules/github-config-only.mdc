# .github/ boundaries — configuration only

## Purpose

Ensure `.github/` contains platform configuration only (workflows, CODEOWNERS, generic PR/issue templates), and does not carry feature- or product-specific documentation or checklists.

## Must

- Keep `.github/` limited to:
  - Workflows under `.github/workflows/`
  - Generic PR/issue templates and config (not feature-specific)
  - CODEOWNERS, dependabot, release configs, etc.
- Place feature/process docs under `docs/`.
- If a feature needs a PR template, use a dedicated template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/<feature>.md` and opt-in per PR, or have tooling append content only for those PRs (never in the generic template).

## Must not

- Do not add feature-specific sections to the generic PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).
- Do not store product docs, playbooks, or facts in `.github/`.

## Examples

- Allowed: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` (generic), `CODEOWNERS`.
- Disallowed in generic template: feature-specific sections; move to `docs/` or a dedicated opt-in template.
