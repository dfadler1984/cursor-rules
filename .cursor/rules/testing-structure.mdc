## Structure

- Keep one primary behavior per `it()`; split variants into separate `it()` blocks.
- Prefer clear Arrange-Act-Assert phases; keep setup minimal and explicit.

### Example (Do)

```ts
it('returns the user when present', () => {
  // arrange
  // act
  // assert
});
```

### Example (Avoid)

```ts
test('returns the user when present', () => {
  // large implicit setup, multiple asserts for different behaviors
});
```
