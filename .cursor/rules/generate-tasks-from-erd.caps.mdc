## Capabilities

- Produce two‑phase tasks from an ERD: parents first → wait for “Go” → sub‑tasks
- Support `dependencies`, `priority`, and `[P]` (parallelizable) markers
- Emit a "Relevant Files" section with likely touched files and test counterparts
- Couple to TDD-first: surface owner specs and test-first posture in sub‑tasks

## Triggers & Routing

- Slash: /tasks
- Phrase: "generate tasks", "tasks from ERD"
- Pause after parent tasks until explicit "Go"

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: ERD path (docs/projects/<feature>/erd.md)
- Output: docs/projects/<feature>/tasks.md

## Constraints & Guards

- Do not generate sub‑tasks until the user replies "Go"
- Prefer ready tasks (deps satisfied); among ready, pick highest priority
- Keep sub‑tasks small, actionable, and test-led; avoid speculative items

## Examples

- "/tasks for checkout using docs/projects/checkout/erd.md"
- "Generate tasks from ERD for search; stop after parent tasks"
