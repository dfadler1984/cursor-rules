# Direct Answers — Root-Cause-First

## Trigger

- Direct questions about behavior or mistakes, e.g. “Why didn’t you X?”, “What caused Y?”, “Who changed Z?”, “Where is W handled?”

## Required Response Shape

1. Cause (one line): State exactly what happened and why.
2. Evidence (one line): Cite the concrete place/signal (file path, hook, log).
3. Next step (one line): Smallest corrective action or confirmation question.

Keep to ≤3 lines total unless asked to elaborate. No rule recaps unless explicitly requested.

## Prohibitions

- Do not restate known policies or what “should have” happened.
- Do not provide generic background or broad overviews.
- Do not defer without a single, concrete next step.

## Example

- Q: “Why didn’t you follow the branch naming rule?”
- A:
  - Cause: I created the branch manually (`git checkout -b feat/...`) instead of using the generator, so it lacked the `dfadler1984/` prefix.
  - Evidence: Pre-push hook enforced the branch naming policy (see `.cursor/scripts/git-branch-name.sh`) → `Branch must start with '<login>/'`.
  - Next: Rename to `dfadler1984/feat-assistant-journal` and push — proceed?

## Notes

- If the direct question implies an edit, propose the minimal fix and ask “Proceed?” once.
- If safety/compliance is at risk, add one short caveat; otherwise keep to the 3-line format.

## Root-Cause Checklist (from Critical Thinking)

- Separate event vs. cause.
- Name the rule/config/hook that enforced the behavior (module + exact check).
- Note enforcement timing (pre-/post- action) and any missing earlier guard.
- Offer the smallest corrective next step; prefer tooling/automation.
