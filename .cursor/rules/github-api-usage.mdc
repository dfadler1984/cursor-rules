# GitHub API automation — Usage

## PR creation (script)

- Use the repo script to create PRs via the GitHub API:
  - `yarn pr:create --title "..." [--body "..."] [--base <defaultBase>] [--head current]`
- The script auto-detects owner/repo from `origin` and falls back to printing a compare URL if API creation is rejected.

## Authentication

- Set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment (classic or fine-grained).
- Minimum permissions:
  - Classic: `repo` scope
  - Fine‑grained: Repository selected + `Metadata: Read`, `Contents: Read`, `Pull requests: Write`
- For orgs with SSO: approve the token for the org.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify token: `curl -H "Authorization: token $GH_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user` → 200 and `X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000`.
- 404 creating PR: ensure repo parsing strips `.git` in remote URL; the script already does this.
- 422 `base invalid`: pass the correct base or rely on auto-detected default (from `git remote show origin`).
- 422 `not all refs are readable`: ensure token can read both base and head refs; use `owner:short-branch`.
- 401 `Bad credentials`: re-export token (no quotes/newlines) and re-approve SSO if prompted.

## Notes

- The script logs a compare URL fallback when API creation isn’t possible; use that to complete the PR in the browser.
