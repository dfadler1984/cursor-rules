## Capabilities

- Apply a quick scope check before edits: risks, clarifiers, safe next step
- Define a minimal acceptance bundle (targets, exact change, success criteria, run instructions)

## Triggers & Routing

- Before code edits or repo-wide changes; when targets are ambiguous

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: user request and intended files/areas
- Outputs: a minimal, testable next step with acceptance bundle

## Constraints & Guards

- Ask ≤3 precise questions if needed; then pause until answered
- Avoid global edits without explicit scope confirmation

## Examples

- "Refactor parsing" → propose editing `web/src/parse.ts` with a single acceptance criterion
