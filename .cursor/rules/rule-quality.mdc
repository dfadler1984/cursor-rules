## Validate before finalizing

- Examples executable/relevant to this repo.
- Globs target intended paths; avoid accidental global attachment.
- No contradictions or duplication with other rules.
- See `front-matter.mdc` for complete front matter standards.
- Examples cite real file paths from the codebase (when pattern-based).
- Rule triggered by ≥3 instances of pattern (if pattern-based).
- Deprecation path documented if replacing old pattern.

## Detail balance

- Avoid >200 lines or excessive nesting.
- Prefer “do this / not that” with 1–2 concrete examples.
- Split overly broad files; merge overlapping files.
