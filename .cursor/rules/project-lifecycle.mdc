# Rule: Project Lifecycle — Completion Policy

## Purpose

Codify how projects transition to Completed without breaking links: status tagging over moves, a closure checklist, a final summary, and an index update. Provide a light validator and optional automation.

## Scope

- Applies to all projects under `docs/projects/<name>/`.
- Completion flows are documentation-first; optional automation is additive and opt-in.

## Status Tagging Schema (ERD front matter)

```yaml
---
status: active|completed
completed: YYYY-MM-DD # required when status: completed
owner: <github-handle-or-team>
---
```

- Location: `docs/projects/<name>/erd.md` (and optionally mirrored in `tasks.md`).
- On archival, move the project folder under `docs/projects/_archived/<YYYY>/<name>/` using a simple move; update index links accordingly.

## Closure Checklist (Definition of Done)

- ERD front matter has `status: completed`, `completed: <date>`, and `owner`.
- All items in `docs/projects/<name>/tasks.md` are checked off.
- Tests/lint/types pass; coverage > 0% for new/changed modules (policy-level check).
- ADRs updated/added for consequential decisions (if any).
- User-facing docs/examples updated (README/guides as applicable).
- Ownership/handoff note present (owner, next review date).

Reference template: `.cursor/templates/project-lifecycle/completion-checklist.template.md`.

## Final Summary

- File: `docs/projects/<name>/final-summary.md`
- Link this file from the ERD near the top.
- Template: `.cursor/templates/project-lifecycle/final-summary.template.md`.

## Projects Index Update

- Landing page: `docs/projects/README.md`
- When a project completes, move its entry from Active to Completed.
- If archived, point the Completed link to `../_archived/<YYYY>/<name>/erd.md`.

## Validator and CLI

- Script: `.cursor/scripts/project-lifecycle-validate.sh`
  - Dry-run by default. Exits non-zero when Completed projects are missing required pieces.
  - Checks (minimum):
    - ERD contains `status: completed`, `completed:`, `owner:` in front matter
    - `final-summary.md` exists
    - `docs/projects/README.md` contains a Completed link for the project

## PR Title Guidance

- Prefer Conventional Commit when closing a project so it lands in `CHANGELOG.md`:
  - `feat: Finalize <Project Name>` (or `feat(projects): finalize <name>`)
  - If the closing PR is purely docs, `docs: finalize <Project Name>` is acceptable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Any project flipped to Completed includes required ERD fields and a final summary, and appears under Completed in `docs/projects/README.md`.
- The checklist template and summary template are referenced from the ERD.
- The validator script reports failures clearly and exits non-zero when requirements are unmet.

## Notes

- Archiving uses a simple move: relocate the folder to `docs/projects/_archived/<YYYY>/<name>` and update links. No redirect stub is required.
- Prefer manual, explicit updates first; automation may be added later.

## Rollout

- Owner: rules-maintainers
- Start manual; optionally add a CI job to run the validator in dry-run mode on PRs that change project docs.

## Archival Move Procedure

1. Confirm project is Completed and stable.
2. Move the folder to `docs/projects/_archived/<YYYY>/<project>/` (simple move).
3. Update `docs/projects/README.md` Completed section to point to the archived path.
4. Prefer a Conventional Commit title noting the archival (e.g., `docs(projects): archive <name>`).
