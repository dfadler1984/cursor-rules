# Rule: Generating an Engineering Requirements Document (ERD)

## Goal

Guide the AI assistant to create a clear, actionable Engineering Requirements Document (ERD) in Markdown, adapted from a PRD-style flow but expanded for engineering needs (architecture, non-functional requirements, rollout/ops). See reference inspiration: [PRD rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/refs/heads/main/create-prd.md).

## Process

1. Receive Initial Prompt
   - User expresses a need to create or update an ERD for a feature or change.
2. Ask Clarifying Questions (Required)
   - Before writing the ERD, the assistant must ask clarifying questions (below) to understand the problem, scope, constraints, and outputs.
   - Provide options (letters/numbers) for quick user selection.
3. Generate ERD
   - Use the structure defined below. Include engineering-focused sections.
   - Omit optional sections if the user opts out.
4. Save ERD
   - Location: `/docs/erd-[feature-name].md`
   - Format: Markdown (`.md`)

### Lite Mode (Optional)

- Purpose: Produce a fast, minimal ERD for small/low-risk work, with a clear upgrade path.
- How to enable: User asks for a "lite" or "quick" ERD, or selects Lite when prompted.
- Output: Same path `/docs/erd-[feature-name].md`, include a header note: `Mode: Lite`.

## Clarifying Questions (pick-letter/number answers encouraged)

Customize based on the prompt. Keep concise and focused:

- Problem/Goal: "What user/business problem does this solve?" / "What outcome is needed?"
- Target User: "Who primarily uses this (persona/team/system)?"
- Scope: "Is this net-new, extension, or refactor? Any non-goals?"
- Core Functionality: "What are the key capabilities and flows?"
- Non-Functional: "Any performance SLOs, latency budgets, throughput, availability, security/privacy, cost targets?"
- Architecture: "Any required patterns, constraints, or integration points to reuse?"
- Data: "What data is read/written? New schemas/migrations? Retention/PII considerations?"
- API/Contracts: "New or updated REST/GraphQL/ev ents? Versioning/back-compat requirements?"
- Ops/Rollout: "Feature flags, migrations, monitoring, rollback strategy?"
- Testing & Acceptance: "What tests prove this works? Entry/exit criteria?"
- Success Metrics: "How will we measure success?"
- Output Path & Naming: "Confirm `/docs/erd-[feature-name].md`? Provide feature-name."
- Mode: "Lite or Full? (default: Full). If Lite, we’ll include essentials only."

Include selectable defaults when possible, e.g. audience, sections to include/omit.

## ERD Structure (Sections)

Include all that apply. If the user opts out of a section, omit it from the final ERD.

1. Introduction/Overview
   - Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2. Goals/Objectives
   - Specific, measurable objectives for this change.
3. User Stories
   - As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
4. Functional Requirements
   - Numbered list of must-have behaviors. Keep clear and testable.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
   - Performance/SLOs, reliability, scalability, security, privacy, compliance, cost.
6. Architecture/Design
   - System context, component/sequence diagrams (describe if no image), key tradeoffs.
7. Data Model and Storage
   - Schemas, migrations, indexing, retention/PII, backup/restore considerations.
8. API/Contracts
   - REST/GraphQL/event contracts, request/response types, versioning, back-compat.
9. Integrations/Dependencies
   - Internal/external services, libraries, feature flags, configuration.
10. Edge Cases and Constraints

- Known risks, limitations, failure modes, degraded behavior.

11. Testing & Acceptance

- Test strategy (unit/integration/e2e), TDD plan, acceptance criteria, test data.

12. Rollout & Ops

- Deployment plan, feature flagging, migration steps, monitoring/alerts, rollback.

13. Success Metrics

- KPIs or measurable outcomes to validate success.

14. Open Questions

- Outstanding decisions or unknowns.

### Lite ERD Structure (Essentials Only)

When Lite mode is selected, generate only these sections:

1. Introduction/Overview — 1–2 paragraphs
2. Goals/Objectives — 3–5 bullets
3. Functional Requirements — 3–10 numbered items
4. Acceptance Criteria — 3–7 bullets
5. Risks/Edge Cases — top 3–5 items
6. Rollout Note — flag/owner/date (one-liner)

Optional (Lite):

- Success Metrics — 1–3 bullets
- Non-Functional — short notes (latency/availability/security/cost) if applicable

Include at the end:

- "Convert to Full ERD" checklist (see below)

### ERD Templates

- Full template: `.cursor/rules/erd-full.md`
- Lite template: `.cursor/rules/erd-lite.md`

## Output

- Format: Markdown (`.md`)
- Location: `/docs/erd-[feature-name].md`
- Filename: `erd-[feature-name].md`

## Audience

- Primary: Junior engineers. Keep requirements explicit, unambiguous, and testable.

## Defaults and Guardrails

- Require clarifying questions before generation.
- Enforce filename/location convention above.
- Include short prompts/examples for each section where useful.
- Keep generated ERDs concise and scannable; prefer numbered lists and bullets.
- Omit optional sections if the user requests; otherwise include all sections.
- Lite mode is permitted for small/low-risk work; include the upgrade checklist.

## Manual Invocation & Intent Routing

- This rule should not auto-attach; it is invoked when the user asks to create an ERD or via manual reference.
- Trigger pattern: <verb> + <erd-term> [optional: <lite|quick>]
  - Verbs: create|generate|draft|write|produce
  - ERD terms: erd|engineering requirements document|engineering requirements doc|engineering spec|eng spec
  - If `lite` or `quick` is present, generate Lite mode
