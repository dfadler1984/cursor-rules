## Capabilities

- Establish testing conventions (unit/integration/e2e focus, patterns)
- Encourage focused runs and meaningful assertions
- Pair with TDD-first for JS/TS edits

## Triggers & Routing

- When tests are authored/updated or failures occur
- Attach alongside tdd-first for implementation work

## Inputs â†’ Outputs

- Inputs: target modules/specs
- Outputs: consistent, behavior-focused tests per repo standards

## Constraints & Guards

- Avoid brittle tests; prefer behavior over implementation details
- Keep tests readable and isolated

## Examples

- "Add unit tests for utils/date.ts with edge cases"
