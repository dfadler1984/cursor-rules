## Deprecation Notice

**This rule has been superseded by the vendor-agnostic `platform-capabilities.mdc`.**

For guidance on platform capabilities (docs as source of truth, citations, handling uncertainty):

ðŸ‘‰ **See: [platform-capabilities.mdc](./platform-capabilities.mdc)**

## Cursor-Specific Notes

- **Cursor Docs:** https://cursor.sh/docs/
- **Context & Limits:** https://cursor.sh/docs/context
- **AI Models:** https://cursor.sh/docs/models
- **Privacy & Security:** https://cursor.sh/docs/privacy
