## Source of truth and citations

- Must: Treat the official Cursor documentation as the single source of truth for capabilities.
- Must: When stating a Cursor capability, include a citation to the relevant docs page.
- Must: If uncertain, say so and defer to the docs rather than guessing.
- Should: Prefer quoting or closely paraphrasing the docs.
- Avoid: Speculating or inferring from marketing/changelogs without a docs citation.
- Resolve conflicts: If memory or prior guidance conflicts with the docs, reconcile to the docs and note the correction.

## Scope

- Applies when discussing Cursor product features (limits, models, tool use, context, UI behaviors).
- For repo-specific automations, see `@capabilities`.
