# Front Matter Standards

## Required Fields

All rule files must include these fields in the front matter:

- `description`: Brief description of the rule's purpose
- `lastReviewed`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format (when rule was last reviewed)
- `healthScore`: Multi-dimensional health assessment (see Health Score Format below)

## Optional Fields

- `globs`: CSV list of file patterns this rule applies to (e.g., `**/*.spec*,**/*.test*`)
- `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule always applies (default: `false`)
- `overrides`: CSV list of directory patterns to override parent rules (e.g., `../foo/**,../../shared-rules/**`)

## Format Rules

### CSV Fields (globs, overrides)

- Use comma-separated values without brackets or quotes
- No spaces around commas
- Do not use brace expansion `{}`; write separate CSV entries instead
- Examples:
  - `globs: **/*.spec*,**/*.test*`
  - `overrides: ../foo/**,../../shared-rules/**`

### Boolean Fields (alwaysApply)

- Use `true` or `false` (lowercase)
- No quotes needed

### Date Fields (lastReviewed)

- Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Examples: `2025-01-15`, `2024-12-31`

### Health Score Format

Health scores use a multi-dimensional YAML object with three required dimensions:

```yaml
healthScore:
  content: green # Accuracy, relevance, no contradictions
  usability: yellow # Length, organization, scannability
  maintenance: green # Up-to-date, no broken references
```

#### Dimension Definitions

**Content** (accuracy and relevance):

- `green`: Accurate examples, no contradictions, addresses stated purpose clearly
- `yellow`: Minor inaccuracies or gaps, mostly relevant
- `red`: Major contradictions, outdated examples, or misaligned purpose

**Usability** (organization and scannability):

- `green`: <100 lines, 2-4 clear sections, scannable format, good examples
- `yellow`: 100-150 lines OR moderate complexity OR needs better organization
- `red`: >150 lines OR poor organization OR excessive nesting OR hard to scan

**Maintenance** (currency and references):

- `green`: Recently reviewed, current examples, valid cross-references
- `yellow`: Slightly outdated or minor broken references
- `red`: Significantly outdated, broken references, or conflicting guidance

## Examples

### Basic Rule

```yaml
---
description: Testing conventions
globs: **/*.spec*,**/*.test*
alwaysApply: false
lastReviewed: 2025-01-15
healthScore:
  content: green
  usability: green
  maintenance: green
---
```

### Rule with Overrides

```yaml
---
description: Team-specific patterns
globs: src/**/*.ts
overrides: ../foo/**,../../shared-rules/**
alwaysApply: false
lastReviewed: 2025-01-15
healthScore:
  content: green
  usability: green
  maintenance: green
---
```
