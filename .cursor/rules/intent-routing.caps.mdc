## Capabilities

- Map user phrases and context to the smallest useful rule set
- Prefer slash-command precedence; attach only what's needed (thin-first)

## Triggers & Routing

- Exact phrase triggers (DRY RUN:) → plan-only behavior
- Composite consent-after-plan → implementation path
- Keywords + file signals → attach testing/TDD by default for implementation intents

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: user message, open files, repo state
- Outputs: selected rules attached (e.g., tdd-first, spec-driven)

## Constraints & Guards

- Ask one concise clarifying question when ambiguous
- Do not auto-create files on medium/low confidence

## Examples

- "Add tests for API client" → attach testing + tdd-first
- "Refactor parse.ts to be pure" → attach refactoring + testing
