## Capabilities

- Enforce one sub‑task at a time and commit protocol
- Respect `dependencies` and `priority` when selecting next work; mark `[P]` appropriately
- Maintain "Relevant Files" and update checkboxes as work progresses

## Triggers & Routing

- When a tasks.md exists and work proceeds on it
- Integrates with git usage rules for commits and branches

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: docs/projects/<feature>/tasks.md
- Outputs: updated tasks.md with progress and accurate "Relevant Files"

## Constraints & Guards

- Pause for approval after each sub‑task; do not start the next prematurely
- Run tests before marking parent complete; keep diffs scoped

## Examples

- "Mark 1.2 complete and propose next ready sub‑task by priority"
