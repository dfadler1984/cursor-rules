## Logging Protocol

- Trigger: After key interactions (e.g., corrections via Third Law, user feedback, or rule conflicts), log the outcome.
- Config: Use a configurable directory (default: ./assistant-logs/). Allow override via environment variable (e.g., ASSISTANT_LOG_DIR) or .cursor/config.json key (e.g., "logDir": "./custom-logs/").
- Storage: Create individual files per log entry or session, named with a timestamp prefix followed by a short descriptive name (e.g., log-2025-09-19T12:00:00Z-law-clarification.md). Generate the description automatically based on the outcome (keep it concise, 3-5 words).
- Format: Each file is Markdown with a single entry, including Timestamp, Outcome, What Worked, Improvements, and Proposed Rule Changes.
- Evolution: Periodically scan the directory the logs are stored in (e.g., via a future /review-rules command or automated script) to aggregate insights and drive rule updates.
- Privacy: Rely on the privacy settings of the repository (e.g., if the repo is private, logs remain internal). Ensure directory is git-ignored if sensitive; do not share logs without explicit user consent.
- Fallback: If dir not writable, fall back to root repository directory docs/assistant-learning-logs/.
