## Capabilities

- Drive Spec → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement across artifacts
- Recognize slash commands: /specify, /clarify, /plan, /tasks, /analyze, /implement
- Cross-link artifacts and enforce Analyze gate before Implement

## Triggers & Routing

- Slash commands take precedence over phrases; on ambiguity ask one clarifying question
- Attach TDD-first when implementation intent is detected (JS/TS pre-edit gate)

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: ERD/spec refs
- Outputs:
  - docs/specs/<feature>-spec.md
  - docs/plans/<feature>-plan.md
  - docs/projects/<feature>/tasks.md

## Constraints & Guards

- TDD-first for any code changes (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Consent-first for file writes

## Examples

- "/plan checkout" after ERD exists → create docs/plans/checkout-plan.md with acceptance bundle
- "/analyze checkout" → cross-check ERD/Spec/Plan/Tasks and report discrepancies
