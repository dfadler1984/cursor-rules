## When to create a rule

- Addresses a recurring, repo-specific issue.
- Not covered by existing rules or external docs (link out if it is).
- Narrow scope; one clear purpose per file.

## How to write it

- Keep it focused (50–150 lines, 2–4 sections).
- Use precise `globs` so auto-attachment only triggers where intended.
- Include 1–2 repo-relevant examples; link related rules instead of duplicating.
- See `front-matter.mdc` for complete front matter standards.

## Avoid

- Duplicating generic guidance (testing basics, SOLID, generic Git).
- Over-broad `globs` (e.g., `**/*`) that cause noisy attachments.
- Project names/paths from other repos.

## Update workflow

1. Make targeted edits; keep filenames stable.
2. Update `lastReviewed` and adjust `healthScore` if scope/quality changes.
3. See `rule-maintenance.mdc` for validation procedures.
4. Test in Cursor by referencing affected files to confirm the rule attaches appropriately.
