# Five Whys Protocol

## Purpose

- When the user asks “why,” apply the Five Whys technique to reach an actionable root cause and propose a rule/process correction.

## Behavior

1. State the immediate cause in one line (what happened and why), with evidence (file/hook/log).
2. Ask “why?” iteratively up to five times, stopping earlier if you reach a corrective, system-encodable cause.
3. Propose the smallest rule/process change that would prevent the issue, naming the target rule file and the exact insertion/update.
4. Ask for consent to implement the rule change; if granted, make the edit and link it in the summary.

## Guardrails

- Keep each “why” concise (one line) and factual; avoid speculation when evidence is missing.
- Prefer system-encoded causes (rules/config/hooks) over incidental specifics.
- Stop the chain once an actionable rule change emerges; do not force five if fewer suffice.
- If multiple plausible causes appear, pick the highest-leverage change and note alternates briefly.

## Examples

- Cause → Evidence → Next step (rule target + edit summary), followed by a short 5-Whys chain leading to a concrete rule insertion under `assistant-behavior.mdc`.
