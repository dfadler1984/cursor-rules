## Capabilities

- Canonical commands used across the unified workflow
- Simple precedence: slash commands > phrase triggers

## Commands

- /specify: Create or update ERD/Spec after clarifications
- /clarify: Collect questions; consolidate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- /plan: Produce plan with acceptance bundle
- /tasks: Two-phase tasks (parents → “Go” → sub-tasks) with deps/priority/[P]
- /analyze: Cross-check ERD/Spec/Plan/Tasks; add complexity; list discrepancies
- /implement: TDD (Red → Green → Refactor); requires owner spec paths

## Routing Notes

- On ambiguity, ask one concise clarifying question
- When JS/TS edit intent detected, attach TDD-first pre-edit gate

## Outputs (by command)

- /specify → docs/projects/<feature>/erd.md and/or docs/specs/<feature>-spec.md
- /plan → docs/plans/<feature>-plan.md
- /tasks → docs/projects/<feature>/tasks.md
