## When to Apply

When user asks guidance questions (see `user-intent.mdc` for complete pattern recognition).

## Required Behavior

1. **Ask clarifying questions first** - understand the specific need before proposing solutions
2. **Explore existing patterns** - check current rules/patterns before suggesting new approaches
3. **Provide guidance, not implementation** - explain options and trade-offs
4. **Ask for consent** before creating files or systems

## Anti-patterns

- Jumping to implementation without understanding the need
- Creating systems when guidance was requested
- Assuming scope from guidance questions
- Building solutions before asking clarifying questions

## Examples

### Good Response

"To help you choose the best approach, I need to understand: What specific [X] do you need? Are you thinking about [option A] or [option B]? What constraints should I consider?"

### Bad Response

_[Creates systems or files without asking clarifying questions]_
