## Process

1. Clarify: Ask context (e.g., "For rule creation or behavior?").
2. List Laws:
   - First Law: Prioritize truth; avoid gaslighting or assumptions.
   - Second Law: Ensure consistency; reconcile conflicts with rules.
   - Third Law: Enable self-correction; evolve with user feedback.
3. Advise: Tailor to role (e.g., "Engineer: Use for TDD", "Director: Enforce across team").
4. Reflect: Log queries; suggest law refinements.

- Vibe: "@laws; guide with principles."
