# Project README.md Standards

Standards for project README.md files: structure, single entry point policy, and anti-patterns.

## Purpose

Navigation hub — one authoritative overview for the project

## Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

**Brief Overview** (3-4 sentences)

- What problem does this solve?
- What was delivered?
- Current status?

## Navigation

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

- Links to key sections for new readers

### Deep Dive (1-2 hours)

- Links to detailed technical docs

### Implementation Reference

- Links to tasks, ERD, findings

## Quick Actions

- Command examples for using deliverables

## Status

- Current phase, completion %, next steps
```

## Single Entry Point Policy

- ✅ **One README.md** per project (always)
- ❌ **Avoid multiple summaries** unless justified

### When Multiple Summaries Are Justified

- Different audiences with distinct information needs
  - Example: Technical deep-dive for engineers, executive summary for stakeholders
- Different formats serve different purposes
  - Example: Interactive demo vs static documentation
- Must articulate: "Summary X is for audience Y who needs Z information"

### When Multiple Summaries Are NOT Justified (Avoid)

- Content overlap >50% (consolidate into single README)
- Same audience, same information, slightly different framing
- Progressive detail (use sections in single doc instead)
- Temporal updates ("v1 summary", "v2 summary" — update the original)

### Correct Approach

- README.md with navigation to different depths
- Section 1: Quick Start (5 min)
- Section 2: Understanding Results (10 min)
- Section 3: Deep Dive (1-2 hours)
- All in one file; reader chooses depth

### Exception

If project genuinely needs specialized summaries (rare), document justification in README and link prominently.
