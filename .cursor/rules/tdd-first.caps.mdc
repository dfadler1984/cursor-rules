## Capabilities

- Enforce owner specs before code edits in JS/TS (pre-edit gate)
- Guide Red → Green → Refactor flow with focused test runs
- Encourage pure cores with effect seams for testability

## Triggers & Routing

- Implementation verbs detected on JS/TS files; attach pre-edit gate
- Requires listing owner spec paths in the plan (acceptance bundle)

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: target files/components and acceptance bundle
- Outputs: updated spec files (failing → passing) and minimal code edits

## Constraints & Guards

- No implementation before a meaningful failing spec exists
- Keep changes minimal; refactor only after green

## Examples

- "Add failing spec for parse.ts, then implement minimal fix"
- "List owner spec paths for route handler before editing"
