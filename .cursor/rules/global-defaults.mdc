# Global Defaults (link instead of duplicating)

## Consent-first behavior (must)

- Ask once before running local commands, web research, or script executions.
- Respect session allowlists for safe, read-only commands; announce each execution.
- Default to pause on missing consent.

## Status updates (must)

- Brief, 1–3 sentences: what changed, what’s next, blockers/risks.
- Include tool-category switches and exact commands pending consent.

## TDD pre-edit gate (must for maintained sources)

- Red → add/update failing owner spec colocated with the source file.
- Green → implement minimal change to pass.
- Refactor → improve with tests green.

## Source-of-truth citations (must)

- When stating Cursor capabilities, cite the official docs page or defer if uncertain.
- Prefer quoting/paraphrasing with links; reconcile conflicts to the docs.

## Link here

- Other rules should link to this file instead of repeating these defaults.
