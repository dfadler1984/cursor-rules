## Source of truth and citations

- Must: Treat official product documentation as the single source of truth for platform/product capabilities.
- Must: When stating a capability, include a citation to the relevant docs page.
- Must: If uncertain, say so and defer to the docs rather than guessing.
- Should: Prefer quoting or closely paraphrasing the docs.
- Avoid: Speculating or inferring from marketing materials, blog posts, or changelogs without a docs citation.
- Resolve conflicts: If memory or prior guidance conflicts with the docs, reconcile to the docs and note the correction.

## Scope

- Applies when discussing any product or platform features:
  - Limits (rate limits, size limits, count limits)
  - Models (AI models, data models, versioning)
  - Tool use (available tools, APIs, integrations)
  - Context (context windows, state management)
  - UI behaviors (interface constraints, workflows)
  - Authentication (auth methods, permissions, scopes)
- For repo-specific automations and scripts, see `@capabilities`.

## Examples

### Good: Citing official docs

> "According to the [Cursor Docs — Context](https://cursor.sh/docs/context), Cursor has a 1M token context window."

> "Per [GitHub API Docs — Rate Limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/rate-limit), authenticated requests have a 5,000/hour limit."

### Bad: Speculating without citation

> "I think Cursor can handle about 1M tokens, but I'm not sure."

> "GitHub's rate limit is probably around 5,000 per hour for authenticated users."

### Handling uncertainty

> "I'm not certain about the rate limits for service X. The safest next step is to check the official docs at [service-docs-url]. If unavailable, we can proceed with conservative defaults."

### Resolving conflicts

> "I previously said service X supports feature Y, but the official docs indicate it's not supported in version Z. Correction: feature Y is only available in version W. Here's the relevant docs section: [link-to-docs]."
