# Changelog & Versioning (Changesets)

This repository uses Changesets to generate `CHANGELOG.md` entries and update the root `VERSION` file via a CI-managed "Version Packages" PR.

## Author workflow (local)

- Add a changeset for user-visible changes:
  - Run: `npx changeset`
  - Select bump type and write a concise summary
  - Stage and commit the changeset: `git add . && git commit -m "chore(changeset): add"`
  - Push your branch as usual

## CI behavior

- On push to `main` with pending changesets, CI opens/updates a bot PR ("Version Packages").
- When that PR is merged:
  - The root `CHANGELOG.md` is updated
  - `package.json` version is bumped and synced to `VERSION`

## Assistant usage

- When a change impacts users (new flags, behavior, docs), propose adding a changeset.
- Prefer mapping to Conventional Commits in the summary; keep it concise and descriptive.
- Do not manually edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `VERSION` — rely on the Version Packages PR.

## References

- See README — Changelog & Versioning section for details.
- Workflow and config live under `.github/workflows/changesets.yml` and `.changeset/config.json`.
