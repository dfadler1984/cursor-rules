## Capabilities

- Promote useful, non-brittle tests with measurable coverage (>0 minimum)
- Couple tests to owners and behaviors rather than internals

## Triggers & Routing

- When assessing test usefulness or refactoring brittle suites

## Inputs â†’ Outputs

- Inputs: target specs/modules and coverage signals (if available)
- Outputs: improved tests and a clearer quality bar

## Constraints & Guards

- Avoid excessive mocks; prefer seams and real behavior

## Examples

- "Raise quality of parse.spec.ts by asserting outcomes and edge cases"
