## Capabilities

- Proactively attach `test-quality.mdc` before writing/modifying tests.

## Triggers & Routing

- Starting new tests where `globs` won’t match yet.
- Adding an owner spec mandated by TDD pre-edit gate.

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: imminent test creation/modification.
- Outputs: attached `test-quality.mdc` with quality safeguards.

## Constraints & Guards

- Do not attach outside testing contexts; defer to smallest useful set.
