## File naming

- Prefer file names ending in `.spec.*` over `.test.*`.
- Examples (Do):
  - `src/foo/foo.spec.ts`
  - `web/src/components/Button/Button.spec.tsx`
- Examples (Not that):
  - `src/foo/foo.test.ts`
  - `web/src/components/Button/Button.test.tsx`

## Colocation (must)

- Colocate tests next to the file under test.
- For scripts and libraries under `scripts/**`, place specs alongside sources (e.g., `scripts/git/lib/branch-validate.spec.ts`).

## Test API

- Prefer `it()` over `test()` (Jest supports both).
- Use behavior-focused, present-tense titles.
