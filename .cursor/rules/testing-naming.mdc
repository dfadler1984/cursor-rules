## Process

1. Clarify: Ask context (e.g., "Unit or integration? Language?").
2. Guide: Suggest naming (e.g., "test<Feature><Behavior>"); enforce colocation (e.g., `src/feature.test.js`).
3. Enforce: Check TDD via spec-driven.mdc; prompt if tests missing.
4. Reflect: Log naming issues; suggest improvements.

- Vibe: "@testing; guide with standards."

## Config

```json
// .cursor/config.json
{
  "testingNaming": {
    "testPrefix": "test"
  }
}
```
