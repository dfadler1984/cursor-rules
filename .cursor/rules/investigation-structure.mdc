# Investigation Documentation Structure

**Purpose**: Organize complex investigations (>15 files) with clear folder structure to prevent root clutter and document proliferation.

**When to use**: Multi-hypothesis investigations with substantial documentation  
**When NOT to use**: Simple projects with <10 files (use basic README/erd/tasks)

## Pre-File-Creation Checklist

**Before creating any new file in an investigation project**, determine category:

- **Session summary**? → `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Analysis document**? → `analysis/<topic>.md` (or `analysis/<topic>/` if 3+ related files)
- **Finding/gap**? → `findings/gap-##-<name>.md`
- **Test results/data**? → `test-results/<hypothesis>/`
- **Decision document**? → `decisions/<topic>-decision.md`
- **Protocol/procedure**? → `protocols/<topic>-protocol.md`
- **Reference guide**? → `guides/<topic>-guide.md`
- **High-level coordination**? → Root (only if coordination.md, MONITORING-PROTOCOL.md, etc.)

**Default**: If unsure, put in `analysis/` and reorganize later if folder warranted.

## Root Files (Keep Minimal)

**Always present** (baseline):
- `README.md` - Entry point, navigation
- `erd.md` - Requirements and scope
- `tasks.md` - Execution tracking

**Optional root files** (case-by-case):
- `coordination.md` - For umbrella projects with sub-projects
- `MONITORING-PROTOCOL.md` - High-level operational protocol
- `findings.md` - Simple projects with 1-3 findings (use `findings/README.md` for 5+)

**Threshold**: Root should have ≤7 files. If >7, reorganize into folders.

## Folder Structure

### findings/
**Purpose**: Individual finding documents  
**Pattern**: `gap-##-<short-name>.md`  
**Example**: `gap-07-documentation-before-execution.md`

### analysis/
**Purpose**: Deep analysis of investigation topics  
**Flat when small**: `<topic>-analysis.md`  
**Subfolder when 3+ files**: `<topic>/analysis.md`, `<topic>/patterns.md`, etc.

### sessions/
**Purpose**: Session summaries (chronological work logs)  
**Pattern**: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

### test-results/
**Purpose**: Data from executing tests  
**Structure**: Organize by hypothesis (`h1/`, `h2/`, etc.)

### decisions/
**Purpose**: Decision documents with options and rationale  
**Pattern**: `<topic>-decision.md`

### protocols/
**Purpose**: Test and validation protocols (how to execute)  
**Pattern**: `<hypothesis>-protocol.md`

### guides/
**Purpose**: Reference guides for using project outputs  
**Example**: `ci-integration-guide.md`

### tests/
**Purpose**: Test plan templates (reusable methodologies)  
**Keep as-is**: This folder structure works well

## Quick Decision Tree

**Creating a file?**

1. **Is it a session summary?** → `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Is it a finding/gap?** → `findings/gap-##-<name>.md`
3. **Is it test execution data?** → `test-results/<hypothesis>/`
4. **Is it analysis?** → `analysis/<topic>.md` (or subfolder if 3+ files)
5. **Is it a decision?** → `decisions/<topic>-decision.md`
6. **Is it a protocol?** → `protocols/<topic>-protocol.md`
7. **Is it a guide?** → `guides/<topic>-guide.md`
8. **High-level coordination?** → Root (only if truly high-level)

**If unsure**: Put in `analysis/` and move later if needed.

## Enforcement

### Self-Check Before Creating File

Ask:
1. What category is this file? (analysis/findings/sessions/etc)
2. Does that folder exist? (if not, create it)
3. Will root have >7 files after this? (if yes, reorganize)

### Validation

**Manual check**:
```bash
# Count root files (should be ≤7)
ls docs/projects/<project>/*.md | wc -l
```

**Future**: Script to validate structure (see Gap #11)
