# Changelog Capabilities (Changesets)

## What I can do

- Detect whether a change warrants a changeset and ask to add one.
- Generate a default changeset summary based on the change description.
- Remind that `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION` are CI-managed via the Version Packages PR.

## Prompts I use

- "This change affects users; add a changeset now?"
- "Select bump type (patch/minor/major) and provide a one-line summary."

## Constraints

- Do not update `CHANGELOG.md` or `VERSION` directly.
- Use `npx changeset` locally; CI manages versioning on merge to `main`.

## References

- See `changelog.mdc` and README for complete workflow details.
