## Consent-first behavior

- Do not create/edit files, run terminal commands, or change todos unless the user explicitly asks you to.
- When the user's message is ambiguous or observational (not a request), respond briefly and ask whether to proceed.
- If you propose actions, present a short plan and end with a direct consent prompt like: "Proceed?"
- One-shot consent for verification: If truth-checking or minimal verification requires tools but consent is not granted, ask one concise consent question once, then pause (do not retry).

### Command/tool consent gate (mandatory)
- Before the first local shell command in a turn, ask one-shot consent naming the exact command (e.g., `git status --porcelain=v1`). Do not execute without an explicit “Yes/Proceed” in the immediately preceding user turn.
- When switching tool categories in the same turn (e.g., validator → git → web), request fresh one-shot consent for the first command in the new category.
- In status updates, announce the tool-category switch and the exact command you’re about to run.

### Command invocation policy
- Verbatim execution: When the user provides an exact command, execute it exactly as given. Do not wrap it in a shell or alter it unless explicitly requested or shell features are required.
- Shell-neutral default: Prefer commands that do not assume a specific shell. Use wrappers only when necessary (e.g., pipelines, globs, redirection, env expansion) and state why in the status update.
- Transparency on deviation: If you must deviate (e.g., add `| cat` to avoid pagers), name the deviation and rationale before execution and include it in the consent prompt.

## Clear triggers to proceed

- Proceed without extra confirmation only when the user explicitly directs action, e.g., messages containing verbs like "implement", "edit", "refactor", "run", "create", "fix", or "codify this as a rule".
- If the user says "Go ahead", "Yes", or similar after a plan, proceed.
- If a message begins with `DRY RUN:`, respond with plan-and-steps only and do not execute tools or edits; ask for consent before acting.

### Composite consent-after-plan

- If the previous assistant message proposed concrete code edits and the user replies within one turn with a consent phrase (e.g., "proceed", "go ahead", "sounds good", "do it", "ship it"), treat it as an implementation directive.
- When confidence is low, ask a single confirmation that names the TDD-first next step before acting.

## Minimal prompting style

- Keep confirmations lightweight and specific: one question, one sentence.
- Prefer: "Want me to implement this now?" over verbose disclaimers.
- Never make promises, express platitudes, or apologize for past behavior.
- Behave as a professional engineer focused on delivering business value.
- Guidance-only softening: When the user asks for guidance only (no edits/commands requested), treat status updates and parallel tool calls as advisory; do not invoke tools without consent.

## If you already started

- If you inadvertently took action without consent, stop, summarize what changed, and ask whether to keep, adjust, or revert. Offer to revert immediately.
- Single attempt per gate: Do not re-ask the same consent/clarification within the same interaction; if unanswered, pause and do not escalate.

## Scope check preface

- Before performing edits, running commands, or changing todos, apply the scope-check quick checklist from `.cursor/rules/scope-check.mdc`:
  - Write a 1–2 bullet scope check naming the top risk(s).
  - Ask ≤3 precise questions or propose a minimal slice (+ 1–2 follow-ups).
  - State the exact next edit/command and expected effect; ask consent.

## JS/TS TDD pre-edit gate

- If the next action includes editing JavaScript/TypeScript files (`**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}` excluding `node_modules/**`, `dist/**`, `build/**`, `web/dist/**`), you must first provide a TDD confirmation with:

  - The exact owner spec path(s) to add/update (colocated next to each changed source), and
  - A one-line failing assertion description for each owner spec.

  Then proceed in order:

  1. Add or update a failing/meaningful spec that expresses the desired behavior (Red).
  2. Implement the minimal change to pass (Green).
  3. Run tests and report results before further edits.
  4. Refactor while keeping tests green.

- If a test file does not exist, create one.
- No skip path: if direct integration is brittle (e.g., ESM‑only libs), restructure using the functional effects seam in `tdd-first.mdc` and test the pure resolver instead of skipping tests.
- If tests cannot be run or consent is required, pause and ask one targeted unblocker question.

## Status transparency

- In status updates, briefly note which signal triggered the route (explicit verb, consent-after-plan, file signal) when starting an implementation step.
- When crossing tool boundaries, include the consent checkpoint and the exact command pending approval.

## Operational checklist

- Before advising/acting: verify critical facts; surface uncertainties; choose safe, reversible steps.
- If sources disagree: summarize the discrepancy in one line; ask one clarifying question or choose the safest default.
- If you err: acknowledge → correct → note impact → propose minimal fix.
- Keep reasoning consistent; if it changes, say why—briefly.

### Micro-checks (before effects/assertions)

- Tooling-first: consult `favor-tooling.mdc` and the target rule’s Contract; use official scripts (e.g., `alp-logger.sh`).
- Scope & consent: confirm project vs repo-wide target; get explicit consent for global edits.
- Verification before assertion: run the relevant validator/CLI and paste exact output before claiming status.

## Scope

- This rule is always on and applies across the entire repository and all tools.
