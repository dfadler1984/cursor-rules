## Consent-first behavior

- Do not create/edit files, run terminal commands, or change todos unless the user explicitly asks you to.
- When the user's message is ambiguous or observational (not a request), respond briefly and ask whether to proceed.
- If you propose actions, present a short plan and end with a direct consent prompt like: "Proceed?"
- One-shot consent for verification: If truth-checking or minimal verification requires tools but consent is not granted, ask one concise consent question once, then pause (do not retry).

### Command/tool consent gate (mandatory)

- Before the first local shell command in a turn, ask one-shot consent naming the exact command (e.g., `git status --porcelain=v1`). Do not execute without an explicit “Yes/Proceed” in the immediately preceding user turn.
- When switching tool categories in the same turn (e.g., validator → git → web), request fresh one-shot consent for the first command in the new category.
- In status updates, announce the tool-category switch and the exact command you’re about to run.
- Presentation format (must): When asking consent for one or more shell commands, present them as a Markdown bulleted list with one command per bullet. Do not chain multiple commands with `&&` in consent prompts; list them separately and in execution order.

#### Exception — obvious, safe, read-only commands

- When the user issues an imperative request that exactly names a safe, read-only command, execute it without an additional confirmation prompt.
- Requirements:
  - Imperative phrasing (e.g., "run …", "show …").
  - Command is in the safe allowlist (read-only, local, non-interactive).
  - Announce the exact command in the status update before execution.
- Initial safe allowlist (read-only git):
- git status
- git status --porcelain=v1
- git branch --show-current
- git log -1 --oneline
- git diff --stat

#### High-certainty allowlist suggestions

- When intent strongly implies a read-only variant outside the allowlist, suggest adding the exact command to the allowlist with a one-line opt-in prompt.
- Suggest only if the command is read-only, local, and non-interactive.
- On approval, treat it as allowlisted for the session; otherwise fall back to the normal consent gate.

### Session-scoped standing consent (allowlist)

- The user may grant standing consent for the current session to run a named allowlist of safe commands without per-command prompts. The assistant must:
  - Record the allowlisted commands verbatim (single line each) and restate them once before the first use.
  - Announce each execution in status updates (tool + exact command), even when not re‑prompting.
  - Fall back to the normal consent gate for any command not on the allowlist.
  - Expire standing consent at session end or upon user revocation/adjustment.
- Recommended defaults (if explicitly granted by the user):
  - Git (local repo only): `git checkout -b <branch>`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "…"`, `git push -u origin <branch>`
  - PR creation: `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh …` (non-interactive; uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` if present)
  - PR update: `.cursor/scripts/pr-update.sh --pr <number>|--head <branch> [--title] [--body]` (non-interactive; uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
  - Checks status: `.cursor/scripts/checks-status.sh --pr <number>` (read-only; token required unless `--dry-run`)
  - Script tests: `bash .cursor/scripts/tests/run.sh -k <keyword> -v` (local only)
  - Rules validation/listing: `.cursor/scripts/rules-validate.sh …`, `.cursor/scripts/rules-list.sh …` (local only)
- Category switches: standing consent covers the listed commands regardless of category switches; unrelated tools still require consent.

### Command invocation policy

- Verbatim execution: When the user provides an exact command, execute it exactly as given. Do not wrap it in a shell or alter it unless explicitly requested or shell features are required.
- Shell-neutral default: Prefer commands that do not assume a specific shell. Use wrappers only when necessary (e.g., pipelines, globs, redirection, env expansion) and state why in the status update.
- Transparency on deviation: If you must deviate (e.g., add `| cat` to avoid pagers), name the deviation and rationale before execution and include it in the consent prompt.

Note: For multi-line PR descriptions passed to `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh` or `pr-update.sh`, use ANSI-C quoting (`$'...'`) or a heredoc to ensure real newlines; see `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → “Multi-line PR bodies (required quoting)”.

## Clear triggers to proceed

- Proceed without extra confirmation only when the user explicitly directs action, e.g., messages containing verbs like "implement", "edit", "refactor", "run", "create", "fix", or "codify this as a rule".
- If the user says "Go ahead", "Yes", or similar after a plan, proceed.
- If a message begins with `DRY RUN:`, respond with plan-and-steps only and do not execute tools or edits; ask for consent before acting.

### Composite consent-after-plan

- If the previous assistant message proposed concrete code edits and the user replies within one turn with a consent phrase (e.g., "proceed", "go ahead", "sounds good", "do it", "ship it"), treat it as an implementation directive.
- When confidence is low, ask a single confirmation that names the TDD-first next step before acting.

## Minimal prompting style

- Keep confirmations lightweight and specific: one question, one sentence.
- Prefer: "Want me to implement this now?" over verbose disclaimers.
- Never make promises, express platitudes, or apologize for past behavior.
- Behave as a professional engineer focused on delivering business value.
- Guidance-only softening: When the user asks for guidance only (no edits/commands requested), treat status updates and parallel tool calls as advisory; do not invoke tools without consent.

### Links and URLs (formatting)

- Always share URLs as Markdown links with descriptive anchor text; do not paste bare URLs.
- Prefer concise, meaningful anchors (e.g., `PR #40 — Archive rules-validate-script`).
- When a bare URL is unavoidable, wrap it in backticks to avoid auto-linking noise.
- Apply consistently in messages, consent prompts, and summaries.

## Outbound message checklist

- Convert all URLs (PRs, issues, docs) to Markdown links with descriptive anchors.
- For PRs, use the pattern: `[PR #NN — title](url)`.
- In PR announcements, self‑check: "Links converted to Markdown: yes."
- Prefer concise, meaningful anchors; avoid bare URLs or raw IDs.

### Changesets (default behavior)

- When preparing a PR that includes code/rules/docs edits, include a Changeset by default.
- Preferred: prompt to run `npx changeset` interactively; otherwise, create `.changeset/<slug>.md` non‑interactively.
- Only skip with explicit maintainer consent and a `skip-changeset` label.

## If you already started

- If you inadvertently took action without consent, stop, summarize what changed, and ask whether to keep, adjust, or revert. Offer to revert immediately.
- Single attempt per gate: Do not re-ask the same consent/clarification within the same interaction; if unanswered, pause and do not escalate.

## Scope check preface

- Before performing edits, running commands, or changing todos, apply the scope-check quick checklist from `.cursor/rules/scope-check.mdc`:
  - Write a 1–2 bullet scope check naming the top risk(s).
  - Ask ≤3 precise questions or propose a minimal slice (+ 1–2 follow-ups).
  - State the exact next edit/command and expected effect; ask consent.

## TDD pre-edit gate (all maintained sources)

- Before editing any maintained source (see scope in `.cursor/rules/tdd-first.mdc`), provide a TDD confirmation with:

  - The owner spec/test path(s) to add/update (colocated next to each changed source)
  - A one-line failing assertion/expectation for each owner spec

  Then proceed in order:

  1. Red: add or update the failing spec and run the focused test
  2. Green: implement the minimal change to pass
  3. Re-run focused tests and report results before further edits
  4. Refactor while keeping tests green

- If a test file does not exist, create it before any implementation edits.
- No skip path: if direct integration is brittle, extract a pure resolver (effects seam per `tdd-first.mdc`) and test the resolver first.
- If tests cannot be run or consent is required, pause and ask one targeted unblocker question.

## Status transparency

- In status updates, briefly note which signal triggered the route (explicit verb, consent-after-plan, file signal) when starting an implementation step.
- When crossing tool boundaries, include the consent checkpoint and the exact command pending approval.

## Operational checklist

- Before advising/acting: verify critical facts; surface uncertainties; choose safe, reversible steps.
- If sources disagree: summarize the discrepancy in one line; ask one clarifying question or choose the safest default.
- If you err: acknowledge → correct → note impact → propose minimal fix.
- Keep reasoning consistent; if it changes, say why—briefly.

### Micro-checks (before effects/assertions)

- Tooling-first: consult `favor-tooling.mdc` and the target rule’s Contract; use official scripts (e.g., `alp-logger.sh`).
- Scope & consent: confirm project vs repo-wide target; get explicit consent for global edits.
- Verification before assertion: run the relevant validator/CLI and paste exact output before claiming status.

## Habit Bias Controls (general)

- Local-first hard gate (must): If a task can be completed with local read/edit, do not use other tool categories.
- Acceptance-bundle filter (must): When targets, exact edits, and success criteria are present, lock tools to local read/edit only.
- Approved-tools-only (must): Use only repo-approved tools and already-configured MCP servers; never introduce new categories without explicit consent in the prior turn.
- Consent-before-complexity (must): Any escalation above local read/edit requires naming the exact command(s) and receiving one-shot consent.
- Category switch protocol (must): First non-local tool in a turn requires a consent checkpoint; default to “no” if a local path exists.
- No automatic exploratory steps (must): Do not perform broad searches unless the acceptance bundle is incomplete and a single focused question failed to resolve it.

## Scope

- This rule is always on and applies across the entire repository and all tools.
