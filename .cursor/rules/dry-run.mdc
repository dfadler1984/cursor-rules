## Purpose

When a user message begins with `DRY RUN:`, treat the request as guidance-only: produce a concise plan and step list, and do not perform any actions.

## Behavior

- Detect exact-phrase prefix `DRY RUN:` (case-sensitive) at the start of the message.
- Output only:
  - a short plan (1â€“3 bullets) and
  - a bulleted list of steps to accomplish the task.
- Do not execute tools, file edits, terminal commands, or modify todos.
- End with a brief consent prompt (e.g., "Proceed?").

## Precedence

- This trigger has highest priority and overrides other routing rules.
- Combine with `guidance-first.mdc` tone (clarify if scope is unclear), but avoid implementation.
