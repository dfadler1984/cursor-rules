# Testing Overview

- This overview anchors testing conventions and links to focused rules.

## Naming Conventions

- See `testing-naming.mdc` for file naming and test API preferences.

## Structure & Style

- See `testing-structure.mdc` for behavior-focused titles and test layout.

## Notes

- Jest config already supports `.spec` and `.test` via `testMatch`.
- Prefer incremental migration: rename when touching a file or alongside nearby changes.

## Environment variables (must)

- Snapshot/restore `process.env` in specs that modify tokens or other env vars:
  - At top of `describe`: `const ORIGINAL_ENV: NodeJS.ProcessEnv = { ...process.env };`
  - `beforeEach`: `process.env = { ...ORIGINAL_ENV };`
  - `afterAll`: `process.env = ORIGINAL_ENV;`
- Prefer wrappers over mutation: expose a `getGithubToken()` helper in the module under test and mock it in specs instead of deleting `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`.
- If you must simulate missing tokens, delete only within the test and restore immediately after, never globally.

## No placeholders (must)

- Do not add placeholder specs or placeholder assertions.
  - Not allowed: `expect(true).toBe(true)`, existence-only checks, empty `it()` blocks, or `.skip` used to satisfy gates.
- Tests must assert real behavior of the owner module (see `testing-naming.mdc` for colocation) and fail meaningfully when behavior is incorrect.
- Assertions should target observable outputs or effects of the SUT’s public API, not incidental internals. Prefer value/result checks over mocks, and when mocking, assert the resulting behavior, not just that a mock was called.

### Examples (good)

```ts
// Owner: src/validateGlobs.ts → src/validateGlobs.spec.ts
it("rejects bracketed globs", () => {
  expect(() => validateGlobs("['invalid']")).toThrow(/invalid format/);
});

// Effects seam injection example
it("formats UTC year-month", () => {
  const fixedNow = () => new Date("2025-10-02T00:00:00Z");
  expect(formatNow(fixedNow)).toBe("2025-10");
});
```

### Anti-examples (avoid)

```ts
// Placeholder assertion — does not exercise SUT behavior
expect(true).toBe(true);

// Existence-only check without behavior
expect(validateGlobs).toBeDefined();
```
