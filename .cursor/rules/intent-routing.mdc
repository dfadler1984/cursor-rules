# Intent Routing Extensions (ERD Tasks)

## Trigger → Rule Attachment

- Trigger: Phrases matching `create|generate tasks from ERD`
- Attach: `generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc`
- Behavior: Use the two-phase flow — output parent tasks first, pause for “Go,” then emit sub-tasks and relevant files.

## Notes

- Keep terminology consistent: ERD (Engineering Requirements Document), not PRD.
- Follow TDD-first rules when generating sub-tasks.

## Intent-routed rule attachment

This lightweight router keeps context minimal by attaching specific rules only when intent is detected in the user's request. It does not duplicate content; it maps intents → rules.

## Triggers → Rules

- DRY RUN (plan-only)
  - Triggers: Message begins with the exact phrase `DRY RUN:` (highest priority exact phrase trigger)
  - Attach: `dry-run.mdc`, `guidance-first.mdc`
- Session Allowlist Query
  - Triggers: <allowlist-phrase>
    - Phrases: show allowlist|list allowlist|show active allowlist|list session consent|what has standing consent|show session consent|active consent
  - Behavior: Display active session standing consent grants with revoke instructions
  - See: `assistant-behavior.mdc` → Session-scoped standing consent → Grant/Revoke/Query Syntax
- Context Efficiency Gauge
  - Triggers: <gauge-phrase>
    - Phrases: show gauge|context efficiency|how's our context|context health|efficiency gauge|show efficiency|context score
  - Attach: `context-efficiency.mdc`
  - Behavior: Run `.cursor/scripts/context-efficiency-gauge.sh` with estimated inputs (scope, rules count, clarification loops, issues) and display the result in the requested format (default: dashboard)
- Create tests
  - Triggers: <verb> + <test-term>
    - Verbs: create|generate|add|write
    - Test terms: test|tests|spec|specs|unit test|jest
  - Keywords (fallback): coverage|assert|assertion|assertions
  - Attach: `testing.mdc`, `tdd-first.mdc`, `test-quality.mdc`
- Refactoring
  - Triggers: <refactor-verb>
    - Verbs: refactor|extract|rename|reorganize
  - Attach: `refactoring.mdc`, `testing.mdc`
- Implement feature / Fix bug
  - Triggers: <verb> + <change-term>
    - Verbs: implement|add|fix|update
    - Change terms: feature|bug|logic|behavior
  - Consent-after-plan (composite): If the previous assistant turn proposed concrete code edits and the user replies with a consent phrase within one turn (e.g., "proceed", "go ahead", "sounds good", "do it", "ship it"), route to implementation.
  - Attach: `tdd-first.mdc`, `code-style.mdc`
- Hard gate: before any implementation edits, require the universal TDD pre-edit confirmation per `assistant-behavior.mdc` (applies repo-wide).
  - Note: Per `user-intent.mdc` policy, testing + TDD attach by default for implementation intents
- Rules authoring/maintenance
  - Triggers: <verb> + <rules-term>
    - Verbs: write|update|maintain
    - Rules terms: rule|front matter|rules validation
  - Attach: `front-matter.mdc`, `rule-creation.mdc`, `rule-maintenance.mdc`, `rule-quality.mdc`
  - Safeguard: treat soft phrasing (e.g., “we probably need to…”, “should consider…”) as plan-only; ask for explicit consent before repo-wide edits. Confirm target scope (project vs repo-wide) and name files before proceeding.
- Cursor capabilities
  - Triggers: <cursor-term>
    - Terms: cursor features|cursor limits|platform capabilities
  - Attach: `cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc`
- Git usage
  - Triggers: <git-term>
    - Terms: commit|commit message|commits|branch|branch name|branch naming|pre-commit|pre-push|conventional commits|git hooks
  - Attach: `assistant-git-usage.mdc`
- Projects lifecycle (simple)
  - Trigger: message contains <projectsDir> (default: docs/projects)
  - Attach: `project-lifecycle.mdc`
- Project lifecycle (actions)
  - Triggers: <verb> + <lifecycle-term> with project target
    - Verbs: archive|archiving|finalize|complete|close
    - Targets:
      - Path: docs/projects/<slug>
      - Or bare slug: <slug> (ask a one-line confirmation for path if ambiguous)
  - Attach: `project-lifecycle.mdc`
  - On attach, propose the appropriate helper:
    - End-to-end archival: suggest `.cursor/scripts/project-archive-workflow.sh --project <slug> --year <YYYY> --dry-run` first, then the non-dry-run on approval
    - Generate final summary: suggest `.cursor/scripts/final-summary-generate.sh --project <slug> --year <YYYY> [--pre-move]`
    - Validate changed project(s): suggest `.cursor/scripts/project-lifecycle-validate-scoped.sh <slug>`
    - Backfill legacy artifacts: suggest `.cursor/scripts/project-lifecycle-migrate.sh --project <slug>`
- PR triggers: pr|pull request|open pr|create pr → prefer repo script `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh` (curl/GitHub API) instead of GH CLI
- ERD creation

  - Triggers: <verb> + <erd-term> [optional: <lite|quick>]
    - Verbs: create|generate|draft|write|produce
    - ERD terms: erd|engineering requirements document|engineering requirements doc|engineering spec|eng spec
    - If the optional modifier `lite` or `quick` is present, select Lite mode
    - Exclusions: review|discuss|read|summarize|compare|analyze (do not trigger creation; ask a brief clarifying question)
    - Prefer: include "for <feature>"; if missing and ambiguous, ask for the feature name
  - Attach: `create-erd.mdc`, `guidance-first.mdc`

- Planning / Specification

  - Triggers: <verb> + <plan-term>
    - Verbs: plan|specify|analyze|outline|draft
    - Plan terms: plan|spec|specification|analysis|acceptance bundle
  - Attach: `spec-driven.mdc`, `guidance-first.mdc`

- Task lists
  - Triggers: task list phrases
    - Terms: task list|update tasks|mark sub-task|mark subtask|check off|relevant files section
  - Attach: `project-lifecycle.mdc` (Task List Process subsection)

## Slash commands

**Git Operations** (HIGHEST PRIORITY — bypass consent gate per `assistant-behavior.mdc`):

- `/commit` → route to `git-slash-commands.mdc` → execute `git-commit.sh`
- `/pr` → route to `git-slash-commands.mdc` → execute `pr-create.sh`
- `/branch` → route to `git-slash-commands.mdc` → execute `git-branch-name.sh`
- `/pr-update` → route to `git-slash-commands.mdc` → execute `pr-update.sh`
- `/status` → suggested (not mandatory) → `git status --porcelain=v1`
- `/diff` → suggested (not mandatory) → `git diff --stat`
- `/log` → suggested (not mandatory) → `git log --oneline -n 10`

**Session Management**:

- `/allowlist` → display active session standing consent grants
  - Output format: bulleted list of commands with revoke instructions
  - See: `assistant-behavior.mdc` → Session-scoped standing consent → Grant/Revoke/Query Syntax

**Other Commands**:

- `/plan <topic>` → route to `spec-driven.mdc` (plan/specify); consent-first; produce plan scaffold
- `/tasks` → route to `project-lifecycle.mdc` (Task List Process subsection); manage/update tasks non-interactively when safe

## File/context signals (supporting)

- If any focused/open/edited path matches `**/*.(spec|test).[tj]s?(x)`, attach `testing.mdc`, `tdd-first.mdc`, `test-quality-js.mdc`.
- If the user mentions "jest", "coverage", or "assert", attach testing rules.
- On implementation verbs (implement/add/fix/refactor/update), attach testing + TDD by default (see `user-intent.mdc`).
- JS/TS files (`*.ts|*.tsx|*.js|*.mjs|*.cjs`): attach `test-quality-js.mdc` for language-specific guidance.
- Shell scripts under `.cursor/scripts/*.sh`: attach `test-quality-sh.mdc` for shell-specific guidance.
- If any focused/open/edited path matches `**/tasks/*.md`, attach `assistant-git-usage.mdc`, `project-lifecycle.mdc`.

## Decision policy (weights)

1. Exact phrase triggers (highest)
   - `DRY RUN:` prefix takes precedence over all other triggers and forces plan-only behavior
2. Composite consent-after-plan (recent concrete plan + consent phrase within one turn)
3. Keyword fallback (word-boundary intent words) if phrases not found
4. File/context signals
5. If still ambiguous and intent suggests implementation, attach testing + TDD and ask one clarifying question

- If ambiguity persists after one clarifying question, do not attach additional rules and pause.

### Role–phase and split-progress advisory

- Prefer phase-consistent routing: when a project is in a planning phase, route “what/why” requests to `spec-driven` over implementation rules.
- Consult split-progress status (if available) to decide between plan vs implement; when unavailable, ask one clarifying question.

## Fuzzy matching & confirmation

- Confidence tiers

  - High: exact phrase or strong synonym match → attach immediately.
  - Medium: fuzzy match (minor typos/synonyms/partial phrase) → ask a 1‑line confirmation; attach only on explicit confirmation (e.g., “Yes”, “Go”).
  - Low: vague/ambiguous → ask one clarifying question; do not attach.

- Fuzzy signals (medium confidence examples)

  - Edit distance ≤2 around key phrases (e.g., "generate tasks from erd" → "gen tasks erd").
  - Synonyms: generate|create|draft; tasks|checklist|steps; ERD|engineering requirements.
  - Partial patterns: "tasks from erd", "erd tasks", "make tasks for <feature>".

- Confirmation prompt (for medium confidence)

  - "I think you want to generate tasks from an ERD and use the two‑phase flow (parent tasks → ‘Go’ → sub‑tasks). Proceed?"

- Safeguards
  - Never auto-create files on medium/low confidence.
  - Prefer smallest rule set when multiple fuzzy matches; ask which rule the user means.
  - Include which phrase triggered the prompt in the status note for transparency.

## Few-shot routing examples

- "Show gauge" → attach: context-efficiency; run gauge script with current context
- "How's our context?" → attach: context-efficiency; display dashboard
- "Context efficiency" → attach: context-efficiency; show gauge line
- "Add tests for the API client" → attach: testing, tdd-first
- "Can you add a spec for rules-list?" → attach: testing, tdd-first
- "Refactor parse.ts to be pure" → attach: refactoring, testing
- "Fix bug in summary CLI" → attach: tdd-first, code-style, testing
- "Increase Jest coverage for parse" → attach: testing, tdd-first
- "Create an ERD for checkout flow" → attach: create-erd, guidance-first
- "Create ERD" → ask for feature name and full vs lite; then attach: create-erd, guidance-first
- "Review the ERD for checkout flow" → do not attach create-erd; ask a clarifying question
- "Update front matter across rules" → attach: front-matter, rule-maintenance, rule-creation
- "Archive docs/projects/rules-validate-script" → attach: project-lifecycle; propose dry-run of the archive workflow

## Routing Sanity Prompts (for validation)

- "Add tests for X" → expect: attach `testing`, `tdd-first` only
- "Refactor Y" → expect: attach `refactoring` (+ `testing` if JS/TS target), not `tdd-first` unless edits planned
- "Create an ERD for Z" → expect: attach `create-erd`, `guidance-first`
- Guidance-only questions → exclude execution/tooling rules

## Notes

- Keep this file small; do not restate target rule content.
- Prefer the smallest matching set of rules to minimize context.
- If multiple triggers match, attach the union (deduplicated).
- Status transparency: In status updates, include which signal triggered routing (e.g., explicit verb, consent-after-plan, file signal) for traceability.
- Logging: The historical Assistant Learning log guidance has been deprecated. Do not auto-log; capture decisions in project docs as needed.

## Handoff contract

Router outputs a normalized context object for downstream rules:

```json
{
  "intent": "implement|plan|refactor|guidance|git|tasks|erd",
  "targets": ["file paths or feature names"],
  "rule": "tdd-first|spec-driven|assistant-git-usage|project-lifecycle|cursor-platform-capabilities",
  "gates": ["consent", "tdd-owner-spec"],
  "consentState": "required|granted|not-applicable"
}
```

Callees must respect `gates` and update `consentState` as they proceed.
