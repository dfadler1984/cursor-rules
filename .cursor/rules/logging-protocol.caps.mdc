## Deprecated

- Content moved to project `docs/projects/assistant-self-improvement/legacy/`.

- High-signal events (TDD Red/Green, Analyze Completed, Task Completed, Rule Added/Updated, etc.)
- Consent-aware; skip writes only if explicitly disabled

## Inputs → Outputs

- Inputs: event context (owner, changes, links)
- Outputs: assistant-logs/ entries (or docs/assistant-learning-logs/ fallback)

## Constraints & Guards

- Redact tokens/headers and secret-like values
- Prefer primary logDir; note fallback reason when used

## Examples
