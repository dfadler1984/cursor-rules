## Capabilities

- Always-on learning logs with redaction and safe fallbacks
- Operation and Dependency Impact sections; improvement triggers supported

## Triggers & Routing

- High-signal events (TDD Red/Green, Analyze Completed, Task Completed, Rule Added/Updated, etc.)
- Consent-aware; skip writes only if explicitly disabled

## Inputs â†’ Outputs

- Inputs: event context (owner, changes, links)
- Outputs: assistant-logs/ entries (or docs/assistant-learning-logs/ fallback)

## Constraints & Guards

- Redact tokens/headers and secret-like values
- Prefer primary logDir; note fallback reason when used

## Examples

- "Log Analyze Completed for ai-workflow-integration with 1 gap found"
