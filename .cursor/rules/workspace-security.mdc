# Workspace Security (Cursor-specific policy)

Focused policy to prevent IDE autorun and related risks in Cursor.

## Cursor prevention (must)

- Enable Workspace Trust in Cursor before opening thirdâ€‘party repositories.
- Do not use or commit `.vscode/tasks.json` with `runOptions.runOn: "folderOpen"` (or direct `runOn: "folderOpen"`).
- When opening unknown repos, audit `.vscode/` first; prefer opening in a non-executing editor to inspect.

## Minimal safe usage

- Remove any autorun settings from tasks before working in Cursor.
- Prefer running tasks manually via command palette instead of on-open triggers.
