# Workspace Security (Cursor-specific policy)

Focused policy to prevent IDE autorun and related risks in Cursor.

## Cursor prevention (must)

- Enable Workspace Trust in Cursor before opening thirdâ€‘party repositories.

```text
.vscode/
.vscode/tasks.json
runOptions.runOn: "folderOpen"
runOn: "folderOpen"
```

- Do not use or commit those autorun settings.
- When opening unknown repos, audit the folder first; prefer opening in a non-executing editor to inspect.

## Minimal safe usage

- Remove any autorun settings from tasks before working in Cursor.
- Prefer running tasks manually via command palette instead of on-open triggers.
