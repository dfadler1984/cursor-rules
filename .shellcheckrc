# ShellCheck configuration for cursor-rules repository

# SC1090: Dynamic sourcing via .lib.sh pattern is intentional and verified

# SC2155: Declare/assign separation is a style preference; we accept combined declarations

# SC2034: Unused variables in test scaffolding and library declarations are intentional

# SC1007: Empty assignments for env isolation in tests are intentional

# SC2076: Regex quoting in validation logic is intentional (literal match desired)

disable=SC1090,SC2155,SC2034,SC1007,SC2076

# Target Bash 4+ (macOS default, Linux standard)

shell=bash

# Minimum severity to report (error|warning|info|style)

# Keep at 'warning' to catch potential issues while allowing intentional patterns

severity=warning

# Note: SC2064 (trap expansion timing) is NOT globally disabled.

# Our cleanup traps intentionally use early expansion (trap "rm -rf '$tmpdir'"),

# which is correct for our use case (temp paths set once, never change).

# Individual # shellcheck disable=SC2064 directives document this choice.
