## Tasks — ERD: Roles & Intent Routing

## Relevant Files

- `docs/projects/roles/erd.md`
- `.cursor/rules/roles.mdc`

## Todo

### Core Role Definitions

- [x] 1.0 Draft ERD skeleton with triggers and posture
- [ ] 2.0 Add per-role examples and transitions
- [ ] 3.0 Link ERD from README and progress doc
- [ ] 4.0 Decide on role nuances and any custom postures (from source ERD)

### Phase Mapping Extension


- Role-to-phase alignment (Director→Specify, Manager→Plan, Engineer→Implement)
- Phase-readiness prompts
- Ambiguity handling

**Dependency**: Requires core role definitions (tasks 1.0-4.0) complete first

## Overall Project Completion

This umbrella project is complete when:

- [ ] ✅ Core roles defined with triggers and examples
- [ ] ✅ Phase mapping complete and integrated
- [ ] ✅ Rule file created (`.cursor/rules/roles.mdc` or integrated into `intent-routing.mdc`)
