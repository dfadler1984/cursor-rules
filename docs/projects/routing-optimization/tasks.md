# Tasks ‚Äî Routing Optimization

## Phase 1: Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Review last 20 conversations for routing decisions (correct/incorrect/delayed)
- [x] Identify top 10 most-used intent patterns and their outcomes
- [x] Document common failure modes (ambiguous signals, conflicting triggers)
- [x] Measure baseline: false-positive rate, context overhead, time-to-route

**Deliverable**: [analysis.md](./analysis.md) ‚Äî Comprehensive baseline analysis with:

- Current routing performance: 68% baseline (script usage 74%, TDD 75%, branch naming 61%)
- Top 10 intent patterns with accuracy rates
- 8 documented failure modes (4 Type 1: rules violated, 2 Type 2: rules missing, 2 Type 3: ambiguous)
- Measurement framework and success criteria

## Phase 2: Optimization ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Refine trigger patterns for top 10 intents based on analysis
- [x] Implement confidence-based disambiguation for medium matches
- [x] Add routing test suite with ‚â•20 test cases covering edge cases
- [x] Reduce redundant rule content via cross-references

**Deliverables**:

- [optimization-proposal.md](./optimization-proposal.md) ‚Äî Comprehensive Phase 2 proposal with 4 optimizations
- [routing-test-suite.md](./routing-test-suite.md) ‚Äî 25 test cases across 10 groups
- Updated `.cursor/rules/intent-routing.mdc` with:
  - Explicit intent override tier (file signals downgraded)
  - Refined triggers for top 10 intents (Implementation, Testing, Analysis, Refactoring)
  - Expanded confidence tiers (High/Medium/Low with thresholds)
  - Multi-intent handling (plan-first default)
  - Confirmation prompt templates

## Phase 3: Validation üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Phase 2 Checkpoint ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Run Phase 2 checkpoint (10 sample test cases)
- [x] Validate logic for critical optimizations
- [x] Decision: PROCEED to Phase 3

**Results**: 10/10 PASS (100%) ‚Äî Exceeds 80% checkpoint target  
**Deliverable**: [validation-session.md](./validation-session.md) ‚Äî Detailed test case analysis

**Validated Optimizations**:

- ‚úÖ Intent override tier (RT-008, RT-009) ‚Äî 100% pass
- ‚úÖ Multi-intent handling (RT-011) ‚Äî 100% pass
- ‚úÖ Confidence-based disambiguation (RT-014) ‚Äî 100% pass
- ‚úÖ Refined triggers (RT-001, RT-004, RT-017, RT-019, RT-021) ‚Äî 100% pass

### Phase 3 Full Validation ‚è∏Ô∏è READY

- [ ] Monitor optimizations during normal work (1 week)
- [ ] Collect ‚â•50 real messages across diverse intents
- [ ] Run full 25-case test suite (manual validation)
- [ ] Measure post-deployment metrics vs baseline
- [ ] Document findings and update `intent-routing.mdc` as needed
