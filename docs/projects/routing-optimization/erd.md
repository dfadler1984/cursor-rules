# Engineering Requirements Document — Routing Optimization

Mode: Lite

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Improve intent routing accuracy from 68% to 100% with 0% false positives through optimization of routing logic, confidence scoring, and trigger refinement.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** — See [`final-summary.md`](./final-summary.md) for full details.

**Key Achievements:**

- Intent routing accuracy: 68% → 100%
- False positive rate: 0%
- Deployed 4 critical optimizations:
  - Intent override tier
  - Multi-intent handling
  - Confidence scoring
  - Refined triggers

**Deliverables:**

- Updated `.cursor/rules/intent-routing.mdc` with optimizations
- Composite consent signal detection
- Multi-intent handling workflow
- Comprehensive test coverage
