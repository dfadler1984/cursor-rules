# Phase 3 Real-World Validation — Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: In Progress (monitoring active)  
**First Finding**: Changeset intent contradiction (documented)

---

## Overview

Phase 3 began immediately after deploying routing optimizations to `intent-routing.mdc`. Real-world monitoring captures actual routing behavior during normal work.

**Objective**: Validate projected improvements (68% → 88-92% routing accuracy) through real usage.

**Method**: Passive monitoring during work, documenting findings as they occur.

---

## Findings Count

**routing-optimization scope**: 1 finding  
**Moved to rules-enforcement-investigation**: 1 finding (Gap #17)  

**Severity Breakdown**:
- High: 0 (in routing-optimization scope)
- Medium: 1 (changeset intent contradiction - composite action handling)
- Low: 0

**Note**: Finding #2 (reactive documentation) moved to rules-enforcement-investigation as Gap #17 (execution compliance issue, not routing issue)

---

## Finding #1: Changeset Intent Contradiction

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Category**: Composite action handling  
**Severity**: Medium

### Quick Summary

User requested: "create a pr with changeset"

**What worked**:
- ✅ Intent recognized correctly
- ✅ Changeset created (`.changeset/routing-optimization-phase-2.md`)
- ✅ Changeset included in commit
- ✅ PR created successfully

**What failed**:
- ❌ `skip-changeset` label applied to PR (contradicts "with changeset")

**Root cause**: GitHub Action `.github/workflows/changeset-autolabel-docs.yml` auto-labels docs-only PRs without checking if changeset already present.

### Cross-Project Impact

**Projects Updated**:
1. ✅ `routing-optimization` — Phase 3 finding documented
2. ✅ `pr-create-decomposition` — Requirements added for changeset handling
3. ✅ `github-workflows-utility` — Workflow fix task created

**Tasks Created** (total: 12):
- Immediate: Remove skip-changeset label from PR #159 (1)
- Investigation: Analyze workflow behavior (1)
- Workflow fix: Update changeset-autolabel-docs.yml (4)
- Assistant behavior: Update assistant-git-usage.mdc (2)
- PR script enhancement: Add changeset flags (2)
- Intent routing: Add composite action pattern (1)
- Related: pr-create-decomposition tests (1)

## Validation Metrics (Ongoing)

### Messages Analyzed

**Count**: 2 messages so far
- "Lets work on routing-optimization" → Implementation intent ✅
- "Please create a branch, commit the changes, and create a pr with changeset" → Composite action (partial) ⚠️

**Accuracy**: 1.5/2 (75%)
- Intent recognition: 2/2 (100%) ✅
- Action fulfillment: 1.5/2 (75%) — changeset created ✅, label contradiction ❌

### Projected vs Actual

**Early Signal**: 75% accuracy (below 88-92% projection)

**Analysis**:
- Sample size too small (N=2) for statistical significance
- Composite action handling gap not covered in Phase 2 optimizations
- Need ≥50 messages for valid comparison

**Next**: Continue monitoring, collect more data points

---

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Composite Actions Need Holistic Validation

**Pattern**: "Action WITH requirement" (e.g., "PR with changeset")

**Gap**: Phase 2 optimizations focused on:
- Intent recognition (which rule to attach)
- Trigger patterns (what user wants)
- Confidence scoring (how certain)

**Missing**: Action fulfillment validation
- Did ALL parts of composite request succeed?
- Are there contradictions (has X but also has anti-X)?
- Should verify state after automation runs

### Lesson 2: Automation Can Contradict Explicit Intent

**Example**: GitHub Action auto-labels based on heuristics, ignoring explicit user request

**Gap**: No mechanism to:
- Detect when automation contradicts user intent
- Prevent or override automated behavior
- Verify final state matches user request

**Recommendation**: Add post-action verification for composite intents

### Lesson 3: Real-World Validation > Logic Validation

**Phase 2 checkpoint**: 10/10 pass (100%) — validated routing logic  
**Phase 3 real-world**: 1.5/2 (75%) — discovered composite action gap

**Insight**: Logic validation checks "would correct rules attach?" but not "does final state match request?"

**Value**: Real-world monitoring essential for discovering gaps in action fulfillment

## Impact on Routing Optimization Project

### Positive

- ✅ Real-world validation working as designed (capturing actual failures)
- ✅ Found gap not covered in Phase 2 (composite action handling)
- ✅ Evidence-based task creation (3 projects updated)
- ✅ Routing recognition working (intent understood correctly)

### Areas for Improvement

- ⚠️ Need composite action pattern in intent-routing.mdc
- ⚠️ Need post-action verification guidance
- ⚠️ Need automation override patterns

### Projected Impact Adjustment

**Original projection**: 68% → 88-92% (routing accuracy)

**Revised understanding**:
- **Intent recognition**: Likely 90%+ (working well)
- **Rule attachment**: Likely 85-90% (optimizations effective)
- **Action fulfillment**: Needs measurement (composite actions gap discovered)

**New metric needed**: "Full request fulfillment" (intent + rules + actions + verification)

---

## Next Steps

### Continue Phase 3 Monitoring

- [ ] Collect ≥50 messages across diverse intents
- [ ] Document additional findings in phase3-findings.md
- [ ] Update metrics as data accumulates

### Address Finding #1

**Immediate** (this session):
- [ ] Commit documentation updates
- [ ] Push to PR #159
- [ ] Remove skip-changeset label from PR #159

**Follow-up** (separate work):
- [ ] Fix changeset-autolabel-docs.yml workflow
- [ ] Update assistant-git-usage.mdc
- [ ] Add composite action pattern to intent-routing.mdc

## Finding #2: Reactive Documentation (Meta-Gap)

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Category**: Investigation methodology  
**Severity**: Medium

### Quick Summary

When Finding #1 was discovered, I offered to fix it immediately instead of proactively suggesting documentation first.

**What worked**:
- ✅ Recognized the routing failure
- ✅ Analyzed root cause correctly
- ✅ Documented thoroughly once directed

**What failed**:
- ❌ Didn't proactively suggest documenting as finding
- ❌ Offered immediate fix first (should be document-first for investigations)
- ❌ Required user correction: "First we need to document this issue"

**Root cause hypotheses** (to analyze):
1. Investigation context not triggering document-first behavior
2. Investigation methodology pattern not internalized
3. Project-type-specific behavior not clear (investigation vs feature)
4. Self-improvement pattern not connecting failure → investigation data

### Cross-Project Impact

**Projects Updated**:
- ✅ `routing-optimization` — Finding #2 documented with 4 analysis task groups

**Tasks Created** (total: 13 for Finding #2):
- Root cause analysis: 5 tasks
- Trigger analysis: 4 tasks
- Rule improvements: 3 tasks (update self-improve.mdc)
- Consider new rule: 1 task (investigation-methodology.mdc)

### Related Patterns

**From rules-enforcement-investigation**:
- Gap #7: Documentation-before-execution not automatic
- Gap #11: Structure violation during investigation
- Gap #12: Self-improve didn't catch violations
- Meta-lesson: "Investigation work doesn't automatically follow investigation methodology"

**This Finding Validates**: Same pattern observed in routing-optimization (investigation about routing discovered routing failure but didn't proactively suggest documenting it)

---

**Status**: Findings documented and organized ✅  
**routing-optimization**: 1 finding (composite action handling)  
**Moved to rules-enforcement-investigation**: Gap #17 (execution compliance)  
**Tasks**: 4 for Finding #1 (routing scope), Gap #17 tasks in rules-enforcement-investigation  
**Cross-project impact**: 3 projects updated + monitoring clarity mechanism created  
**Monitoring**: Continues during normal work

**Monitoring Clarity**: Created [`ACTIVE-MONITORING.md`](../ACTIVE-MONITORING.md) to prevent future project scope confusion
