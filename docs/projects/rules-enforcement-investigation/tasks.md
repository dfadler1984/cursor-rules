  - [x] 32.1 Create pr-labels.test.sh (TDD violation corrected) ✅
    - Created: `.cursor/scripts/pr-labels.test.sh`
    - Tests: --help, argument validation, missing token handling, JSON parsing
    - Status: 7/7 tests passing
    - Follow TDD for any script improvements
  - [ ] 32.2 Add integration tests for pr-labels.sh — ⏸️ DEFERRED (Optional Enhancement)
    - Current: Unit tests cover argument parsing, error handling, basic logic
    - Integration tests require: Mock server or test repo (complex setup)
    - Decision: Unit tests sufficient for current needs; integration tests future enhancement
  - [x] 32.3 Strengthen script-first OUTPUT enforcement — Complete: Added MANDATORY (BLOCKING) to assistant-behavior.mdc
    - Review: H3 OUTPUT requirement violated (Gap #18)
    - Pattern: Same as Gap #17 (OUTPUT exists, violated anyway)
    - Solution: Made capabilities check blocking (not just visible) — lines 313-315
  - [x] 32.4 Document script-first violation pattern — Complete: Created analysis/script-first-violation-pattern.md
    - Documented: Gaps #14, #15, #18 (3 violations, all during complex workflows)
    - Analysis: Complexity correlates with bypass rate (table with evidence)
    - Hypothesis: CONFIRMED (100% bypass for complex workflows, 0% for simple)
    - Recommendations: Blocking gates (implemented) + workflow simplification (future)

## Carryovers (Optional Enhancements)

**These are deferred enhancements, not blocking issues. All required work is complete.**

### H2/H3 Monitoring Continuation (Transparency Value Assessment)

**Current State**: Passive monitoring active; Checkpoint 1 complete (100% visibility validated)

**Remaining Checkpoints**:

- Checkpoint 2: After 5 responses with actions (validate sustained visibility)
- Checkpoint 3: After 10 responses (analyze compliance impact)
- Checkpoint 4: After 20 responses (final assessment)

**Decision**: Defer active tracking; allow passive accumulation

- **Rationale**: H1 already at 100% compliance; H2/H3 assess transparency value, not critical path
- **Status**: Data accumulates naturally during work; analyze when sufficient data available
- **No blocking**: Investigation complete without formal H2/H3 conclusion

### Integration Tests (Task 32.2)

**Scope**: pr-labels.sh integration tests with live GitHub API or mock server

**Decision**: Deferred as optional enhancement

- **Rationale**: Unit tests (7/7 passing) cover argument parsing, error handling, basic logic
- **Current coverage**: Sufficient for current needs
- **Future**: Add integration tests if script reliability issues emerge

## Summary

**Current Status**: COMPLETE (Active) — All required work done; optional monitoring deferred  
**Next Milestone**: Ready for archival consideration (no blocking work remaining)  
**Completion**: 100% core + 100% Phase 6G (9/9 tasks); 2 optional enhancements deferred to Carryovers

**Key Insights**:

- AlwaysApply works for ~20 critical rules but doesn't scale to 44 (+97% context cost)
- Slash commands runtime routing wrong: Cursor's `/` loads prompt templates (per [Cursor 1.6 docs](https://cursor.com/changelog/1-6)), not runtime routes
- Gap #10 (analytical error): Overcorrected "our approach failed" to "feature not viable"
- Prompt template approach unexplored (could still improve compliance or discoverability)
- Testing paradox validated: One real usage attempt (30 seconds) found design mismatch that 50 test trials (8-12 hours) would have missed
- H1 at 96% compliance likely sufficient; prompt templates remain future option

**What's Complete** ✅:

1. ✅ Discovery tasks (0.1-0.6) — All analysis and pre-test work done
2. ✅ Review R.1 and R.2 — Test plans validated, premature completion analyzed
3. ✅ Rule improvements (15.0-20.0) — 6 rule improvements applied to 4 files
4. ✅ Phase 6C — Slash commands runtime routing wrong; platform constraint documented
5. ✅ Testing paradox validated — Real usage > prospective testing
6. ✅ **Phase 6A (H1 validation)** — **30 commits analyzed; 100% compliance validated** (+26 points, exceeds 90% target) ✅
7. ✅ **Phase 6D (Synthesis)** — Decision tree created, 25 rules categorized, scalable patterns documented
8. ✅ **Gap #12 discovered** — Self-improve structure blind spot (validates H2 findings)
9. ✅ **Structure reorganized** — Root files moved to correct locations (8 → 5 files)
10. ✅ **Gap #13 discovered** — Self-improve missed Gap #6 repetition (summary proliferation)
11. ✅ **Gap #14 discovered** — Findings review reveals duplicates, 13+ missing tasks
12. ✅ **Findings reviewed** — Consolidated duplicates, extracted all proposed actions to Phase 6G
13. ✅ **Gap #15 discovered** — Changeset label violation (3rd time) + script bypass during PR #149 creation (validates need for blocking gates)
14. ✅ **Gap #16 discovered** — findings/README.md bloat (full details embedded vs individual files per investigation-structure.mdc)
15. ✅ **Findings reorganized** — Extracted Gaps 1-10, 14 to individual files; README 484 → 216 lines (55% reduction)

**What's In Progress** ⏸️:

7. ⏸️ Phase 6B (H2 monitoring) — Visible gate implemented; Checkpoint 1 complete (100% visibility); passive monitoring
8. ⏸️ Phase 6B (H3 monitoring) — Visible query implemented; passive monitoring

**What's Complete (Phase 6G)** ✅:

13. ✅ **Phase 6G complete** — 9 tasks (24.0-32.0) with 30+ sub-tasks applied
14. ✅ **4 rules updated**: self-improve, investigation-structure, project-lifecycle, assistant-behavior
15. ✅ **2 scripts improved**: check-tdd-compliance (filter enhanced), check-tdd-compliance.test (robust tests)
16. ✅ **Blocking gates implemented**: Pre-send gate now halts on FAIL, mandatory script usage, label consistency checks
17. ✅ **Pattern-aware prevention**: Self-improve checks recently documented gaps before actions
18. ✅ **Pre-file-creation OUTPUT**: Explicit categorization before creating investigation files

**What's Deferred** ⏸️:

19. ⏸️ Task 32.2: pr-labels.sh integration tests (optional enhancement - unit tests sufficient)
20. ⏸️ Optional: Continue H2/H3 monitoring (transparency value assessment)

**Completed Steps**:

1. ✅ **H1 validation complete** (100% compliance validated)
2. ✅ **Synthesis complete** (decision tree, 25-rule categorization done)
3. ✅ **Gap #12-18 documented** (self-improve blind spots, blocking gates, script-first violations)
4. ✅ **Findings review complete** (duplicates consolidated, proposed actions extracted)
5. ✅ **Phase 6G COMPLETE** (9 rule improvements, 30+ sub-tasks applied)
6. ✅ **All rule improvements applied**: 4 rules updated, 2 scripts improved, blocking gates operational
7. ✅ **Validation passing**: rules-validate.sh OK, all tests passing

**Optional Continuation**:

8. ⏸️ Continue H2/H3 monitoring (transparency value assessment - data accumulating passively)
9. ⏸️ Task 32.2: pr-labels.sh integration tests (optional enhancement - unit tests cover current needs)
