# Preliminary Hooks Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Initial testing - inconclusive results

---

## Critical Finding: Hooks May Not Work as Expected

### Test 1 Result: Hook Did Not Trigger

**Configuration tested**:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [
      {
        "command": "date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S - Hook triggered' >> /tmp/cursor-hook-test.log",
        "description": "Test hook - logs when any file is edited"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**What we tried**:

- ✅ Created `.cursor/hooks.json` with valid JSON
- ✅ Created/edited files using agent tools (`write`, `search_replace`)
- ❌ Hook did NOT execute (no log file created)

---

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Restart/Reload Required

**Hypothesis**: Cursor needs to be restarted to load hooks.json

**Evidence**:

- Many configuration changes require app restart
- Hooks.json was created mid-session

**Test needed**: Restart Cursor and try again

---

### 2. Agent Mode vs Chat Mode

**Hypothesis**: Hooks only work in "Agent" mode, not "Chat" mode

**Evidence from docs**:

- Documentation path: `/docs/agent/hooks` (note "agent" in URL)
- May be specific to Agent workspace mode

**Question for user**: Are we in Agent mode or Chat mode?

**Test needed**: Try hooks in Agent mode if not already

---

### 3. Tool vs Manual Edit Distinction

**Hypothesis**: Hooks trigger on manual file edits, not tool-based edits

**Reasoning**:

- We used `write` and `search_replace` tools
- Hooks may only trigger for human-initiated edits in editor
- "afterFileEdit" might mean "after user edits file in Cursor editor"

**Test needed**: User manually edits a file to test

---

### 4. Async/Timing Issues

**Hypothesis**: Hooks run asynchronously and may complete after we checked

**Test needed**: Wait longer, check log again

---

### 5. Permission/Path Issues

**Hypothesis**: Hook command failed due to permissions or path issues

**Tests needed**:

- Try simpler command: `touch /tmp/cursor-hook-worked.txt`
- Try with absolute paths
- Check Cursor logs for errors

---

### 6. Version/Feature Availability

**Hypothesis**: Hooks not available in current Cursor version or plan

**Evidence**:

- Feature might be beta/experimental
- May require specific Cursor version
- May require Pro/Enterprise plan

**Question for user**: What Cursor version? What plan?

---

## Impact on Investigation

### If Hooks Don't Work (Worst Case)

**Back to original approach**:

- ✅ AlwaysApply for critical rules (validated at 80%)
- ✅ Commands (prompt templates) for user-triggered workflows
- ✅ External validation (CI/pre-commit) for deterministic checks
- ✅ Improved routing for conditional rules

**Not catastrophic**: Our investigation already found 80% compliance with alwaysApply

---

### If Hooks Work But With Limitations

**Possible scenarios**:

1. **Hooks work in Agent mode only** → Need to use Agent mode
2. **Hooks trigger on manual edits only** → Limited automation
3. **Hooks require restart** → Validated after restart
4. **Hooks have narrow scope** → Use for specific cases only

**Still valuable**: Even limited hooks better than nothing

---

### If Hooks Work Fully (Best Case)

**Game changer**:

- ✅ Near-100% automated enforcement
- ✅ No context cost
- ✅ Scalable solution for all rule types
- ✅ Validates user intuition about slash commands + automation

---

## User Input Needed

To proceed with hooks testing, we need:

1. **Restart Cursor** - Load hooks.json fresh
2. **Confirm mode** - Are we in Agent mode or Chat mode?
3. **Manual test** - User edits test-hooks-trigger.txt manually in Cursor editor
4. **Version info** - What Cursor version? (Help > About or Cmd+Shift+P > "Cursor: Version")
5. **Check logs** - Any errors in Cursor's developer console?

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. **Don't abandon alwaysApply approach** - Still validated at 80%
2. **Continue with commands/templates** - Known to work
3. **Treat hooks as experimental** - Until validated

### After User Testing

**If hooks work**:

- Redesign investigation with hooks as primary pattern
- Test hooks for TDD enforcement (deterministic, perfect fit)
- Compare hooks vs alwaysApply effectiveness

**If hooks don't work**:

- Document as limitation/future work
- Proceed with original plan (alwaysApply + commands + routing)
- Note for future: monitor Cursor updates for hooks support

---

## Meta-Lesson

**Another "check docs first" moment**:

- We discovered hooks from docs (good!)
- But didn't validate they work before pivoting entire investigation
- Same pattern as slash commands (assumed runtime routing, reality was templates)

**Better approach**:

1. Discover feature in docs
2. **Validate it works** (quick test)
3. Then redesign based on validated capabilities

**This is itself a finding about our investigation methodology**

---

**Status**: Awaiting user input for continued testing  
**Next**: User restarts Cursor, tests hooks, provides feedback  
**Then**: Update investigation based on validated hooks capabilities (or lack thereof)
