### ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

**New to this project?** Start here:

1. Read the **Quick Summary** section below (what was found, what was fixed)
2. Read [`findings.md`](findings.md) for outcomes and 5 rule gaps discovered
3. View baseline: `bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 100`

### ðŸ“Š Understanding Results (10 minutes)

**Want to understand the metrics?**

- [`BASELINE-REPORT.md`](BASELINE-REPORT.md) â€” Measured compliance scores (68% overall)
- Review what improved and what needs attention

### ðŸ”¬ Deep Dive (1-2 hours)

**Want comprehensive technical details?**

- [`discovery.md`](discovery.md) â€” Full analysis of 15+ rules, 6 enforcement patterns, structural improvements
- Sections 10-11 contain the meta-test results that proved the root cause

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Reference

**Executing or tracking work?**

- [`tasks.md`](tasks.md) â€” Phase checklists, status, and carryovers for follow-up work
- [`erd.md`](erd.md) â€” Original requirements and investigation approach
- [`tests/`](tests/) â€” 7 detailed test plans (H0, H1 executed; H2, H3, slash commands deferred)

## Project Overview

**Problem**: Assistant violated script-first and consent-first rules despite proper rule configuration.

**Objective**: Investigate how Cursor rules are processed and identify why violations occur.

**Result**: âœ… Root cause identified and fixed in <1 day using meta-test approach.

**Key Finding**: Rules with `alwaysApply: false` are conditionally attached via keyword routing, which can be missed. Changing `assistant-git-usage.mdc` to `alwaysApply: true` fixes the primary issue.

**ROI**: ~20-30x (4 weeks planned â†’ <1 day actual)

## Quick Actions

### View Current Compliance

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 100
```

### Run Specific Checks

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/check-script-usage.sh --limit 100
bash .cursor/scripts/check-tdd-compliance.sh --limit 100
bash .cursor/scripts/check-branch-names.sh
```

### Execute Deferred Tests

See `tests/` directory for detailed test plans:

- H2: Send gate enforcement investigation
- H3: Query visibility improvements
- Slash commands experiment

Each test plan includes implementation checklist and success criteria.

## Status

**Project Status**: âœ… Complete â€” Primary objective achieved  
**Fix Applied**: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` changed to `alwaysApply: true`  
**Next Steps**: See `tasks.md` for monitoring plan and rule improvement carryovers

**Confidence**: HIGH (empirical evidence via meta-test)
