## Project Overview

**Problem**: Assistant violated script-first and consent-first rules despite proper rule configuration.

**Objective**: Investigate how Cursor rules are processed, identify why violations occur, and discover scalable enforcement patterns for 25+ conditional rules.

**Status**: COMPLETE (Active). H1 validated at 100% compliance (+26 points, exceeds target). Decision tree created, 25 rules categorized, scalable patterns documented. **Phase 6G COMPLETE** (2025-10-24): All 9 rule improvements applied — 4 rules updated, 2 scripts improved, blocking gates implemented.

**What's Complete**:

- ✅ Measurement framework built
- ✅ Baseline metrics established (68% overall)
- ✅ Meta-test proved rules CAN work
- ✅ **H1 fix validated** (74% → 100% script usage, exceeds 90% target)
- ✅ 6 rule improvements applied
- ✅ **Synthesis complete** (decision tree, 25-rule categorization, scalable patterns)
- ✅ **16 meta-findings documented** (Gaps #1-16) — 9 violations validate enforcement patterns through lived experience

**Optional Continuation (Deferred to Carryovers)**:

- ⏸️ H2/H3: Monitoring continuation (transparency value assessment)
  - Checkpoint 1 complete (100% visibility validated)
  - Data accumulates passively; analyze when sufficient data available
  - Not blocking: H1 at 100% compliance already exceeds target

**Phase 6G Complete (2025-10-24)**:

- ✅ All 9 rule improvement tasks applied (24.0-32.0, 30+ sub-tasks)
- ✅ **4 rules updated**:
  - `self-improve.mdc`: Pre-file-creation OUTPUT, pattern-aware prevention, ACTIVE-MONITORING reference
  - `investigation-structure.mdc`: Explicit OUTPUT requirement for categorization
  - `project-lifecycle.mdc`: Findings review checkpoint, task naming guidance
  - `assistant-behavior.mdc`: Blocking gates (DO NOT SEND on FAIL), mandatory script usage, label consistency
- ✅ **2 scripts improved**:
  - `check-tdd-compliance.sh`: Doc-only change filtering (deletions tracking)
  - `check-tdd-compliance.test.sh`: Robust test cases (handles both outputs)
- ✅ **All validation passing**: rules-validate.sh OK (59 files), all tests passing

**Carryovers (Optional Enhancements)**:

- ⏸️ **H2/H3 monitoring**: Passive data accumulation (analyze when sufficient data available)
  - Checkpoint 1: ✅ 100% visibility validated
  - Remaining: Checkpoints 2-4 for transparency value assessment
  - Not blocking: H1 at 100% already exceeds compliance targets
- ⏸️ **Task 32.2**: pr-labels.sh integration tests
  - Deferred: Unit tests (7/7) sufficient for current needs
  - Future: Add if script reliability issues emerge

## Status

**Project Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Active) — Core Investigation Done  
**Current Phase**: Complete — Phase 6G tracked as carryover  
**Completion**: 100% core investigation; 6 carryover tasks for rule improvements  
**Fixes Applied**:

- H1: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true` — **VALIDATED at 100%** (+26 points, exceeds 90% target) ✅
- H2: `assistant-behavior.mdc` → visible gate output (Checkpoint 1: 100% visibility; optional continuation)
- H3: visible query output ("Checked capabilities.mdc...") (implemented; optional monitoring)

**What's Complete**:

- ✅ All Discovery work (0.1-0.6): Analysis of 25 conditional rules, scalability study, pre-test prep
- ✅ All Review work (R.1-R.2): Test plans validated, premature completion root causes analyzed
- ✅ All Rule Improvements (15.0-20.0): 6 improvements applied to 4 rule files
- ✅ **Phase 6A: H1 Validation** — 30 commits analyzed; 100% compliance validated (+26 points, exceeds 90% target)
- ✅ Phase 6C: Slash commands runtime routing wrong (design mismatch); prompt templates unexplored; testing paradox validated
- ✅ **Phase 6D: Synthesis** — Decision tree created, 25 rules categorized, scalable patterns documented
- ✅ **Phase 6F: Documentation** — Structure reorganized (8 → 5 root files), Gap #12 documented
- ✅ New project created: assistant-self-testing-limits (testing paradox + platform constraints)
- ✅ Meta-findings: **16 gaps** documented (Gaps #1-16) — 9 violations validate enforcement patterns
- ✅ **Findings reorganized** — Extracted to individual files per investigation-structure.mdc (484 → 216 lines)

**All Work Complete**:

1. ✅ H1 validation complete (100% compliance validated)
2. ✅ Synthesis complete (decision tree, 25-rule categorization, scalable patterns)
3. ✅ Structure reorganized (5 root files, all categorized correctly)
4. ✅ Gaps #1-18 documented (11 violations validate enforcement findings)
5. ✅ Findings consolidated (9 cross-project gaps renamed with status suffixes)
6. ✅ **Phase 6G complete** (9 rule improvements, 4 rules updated, 2 scripts improved)
7. ✅ **Blocking gates implemented** (pre-send gate halts on FAIL)
8. ✅ **Pattern-aware prevention** (checks recently documented gaps)
9. ✅ All validation passing (rules, tests, structure)

**Key Insights**:

- **H1 validated at 100%**: AlwaysApply highly effective for critical rules (74% → 100%, +26 points)
- **Decision tree created**: When to use AlwaysApply vs visible gates vs routing vs CI/linting
- **25 rules categorized**: 5-10 AlwaysApply candidates, 5-7 visible gate candidates, 10-12 conditional
- AlwaysApply works for ~20 critical rules but doesn't scale to 44 (+97% context cost)
- Slash commands runtime routing wrong; prompt templates unexplored
- Testing paradox validated: Real usage > prospective testing
- **18 meta-findings** validate enforcement patterns through lived experience (Gaps #1-18, 11 violations)
- **Findings reorganized**: Individual gap files + historical/fixed gaps clearly marked (484 → 216 lines)
- **Phase 6G COMPLETE**: 9 rule improvements applied, blocking gates operational
- **Complexity hypothesis CONFIRMED**: Multi-step behaviors (4+ actions) have 0-50% compliance even with AlwaysApply; blocking gates required
