## Navigation

**Quick Start** (5 minutes):

1. Read this file (Quick Summary below)
2. Read [`findings.md`](findings.md) — Outcomes & 5 rule gaps

**Deep Dive** (1-2 hours):

- [`discovery.md`](discovery.md) — Comprehensive analysis (1,389 lines)
- [`BASELINE-REPORT.md`](BASELINE-REPORT.md) — Measured metrics

**Execution Details**:

- [`tasks.md`](tasks.md) — Checklists and status
- [`erd.md`](erd.md) — Requirements and approach
- [`tests/`](tests/) — 7 test plans

## Quick Summary

**Problem**: Assistant violated script-first and consent-first rules despite `alwaysApply: true`

**Root Cause Found**: Conditional attachment (`alwaysApply: false` on git-usage rule)

**Fix Applied**: Changed `assistant-git-usage.mdc` to `alwaysApply: true`

**Evidence**: Meta-test with self-improve rule proved mechanism works

**Time**: <1 day (vs 4 weeks planned) — answered fundamental question in 5 minutes!

- H2, H3, slash commands deferred (optional)
- Measurement framework implemented ✅

---

## What We Found

### ✅ Rules WORK When Structured Correctly

**Proof**: Self-improve rule (alwaysApply: true) followed perfectly

- Pattern detection accurate (5 test plans identified)
- Checkpoint triggered correctly (task completion)
- Proposal format perfect (all 4 fields)
- Evidence accurate (all files listed)

### ❌ Conditional Attachment Breaks Enforcement

**Problem**: Git-usage rule had `alwaysApply: false`

- Only in context when keywords trigger routing
- Could miss: "save this work", "record changes", etc.
- Result: Violations occurred

**Solution**: Make high-risk rules always-apply

---

## What We Built

### Measurement Framework ✅

- 4 compliance checkers (script usage, TDD, branch naming, dashboard)
- All TDD tests passing
- Baseline established: 68% overall compliance

### Documentation ✅

- 6 core documents (~2,500 lines after consolidation)
- 7 test plans (reusable for future investigations)
- Discovery, findings, baseline metrics

### Rules ✅

- Fixed: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` (always-apply)
- Created: `test-plan-template.mdc` (pattern proposal)

---

## Baseline Metrics (Measured)

```
Script Usage:    71% (target: >90%)
TDD Compliance:  72% (target: >95%)
Branch Naming:   62% (target: >90%)
─────────────────────────────────────
Overall Score:   68% (target: >90%)
```

**Self-Improve**: 100% ✅ (meta-test validation)

---

## Impact

**Immediate**:

- Root cause fixed (git-usage always-apply)
- Measurement tools working
- Baseline established

**Expected**:

- Script-first violations stop
- New commits approach 100% conventional
- Ongoing monitoring enabled

**Long-Term**:

- Evidence-based rule authoring guidelines
- Reusable test plans and templates
- Pattern-driven improvement validated

---

## Recommendations

### Implemented ✅

1. Git-usage made always-apply
2. Measurement framework built
3. Baseline established

### Next Steps 📋

4. Monitor improvement (next 20-30 commits)
5. Audit other conditional rules
6. Address TDD and branch naming gaps

### Optional (Deferred)

- Hypothesis 2: Send gate investigation
- Hypothesis 3: Query visibility
- Slash commands experiment

## Quick Start

**To view baseline**:

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 100
```

**To understand findings**:

1. Read [`findings.md`](findings.md) — Outcomes & 5 rule gaps discovered
2. Read [`discovery.md`](discovery.md) — Deep analysis (section 10-11 for meta-test)

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete and successful  
**ROI**: ~20-30x (weeks saved)  
**Confidence**: HIGH (empirical evidence)
