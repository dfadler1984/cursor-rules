## Project Overview

**Problem**: Assistant violated script-first and consent-first rules despite proper rule configuration.

**Objective**: Investigate how Cursor rules are processed, identify why violations occur, and discover scalable enforcement patterns for 25+ conditional rules.

**Status**: COMPLETE (Active). H1 validated at 100% compliance (+26 points, exceeds target). Decision tree created, 25 rules categorized, scalable patterns documented. Phase 6G rule improvements tracked as carryover work.

**What's Complete**:

- ✅ Measurement framework built
- ✅ Baseline metrics established (68% overall)
- ✅ Meta-test proved rules CAN work
- ✅ **H1 fix validated** (74% → 100% script usage, exceeds 90% target)
- ✅ 6 rule improvements applied
- ✅ **Synthesis complete** (decision tree, 25-rule categorization, scalable patterns)
- ✅ **16 meta-findings documented** (Gaps #1-16) — 9 violations validate enforcement patterns through lived experience

**Optional Continuation**:

- ⏸️ H2: Pre-send gate visibility monitoring (transparency value assessment)
- ⏸️ H3: Query visibility monitoring (deferred - H1 already 100%)

**Carryover Work (Phase 6G)**:

- 📝 6 rule improvements from meta-findings (tracked in tasks.md Phase 6G)
  - Gap #12, #13, #14 improvements: self-improve, project-lifecycle, investigation-structure
  - TDD compliance improvements: check-tdd-compliance.sh, setup-remote.test.sh
  - Structure enforcement validation
- 📝 Optional: H2/H3 continued monitoring (transparency value assessment)
- 📝 Optional: Prompt templates exploration (lower priority with H1 at 100%)

## Status

**Project Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Active) — Core Investigation Done  
**Current Phase**: Complete — Phase 6G tracked as carryover  
**Completion**: 100% core investigation; 6 carryover tasks for rule improvements  
**Fixes Applied**:

- H1: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true` — **VALIDATED at 100%** (+26 points, exceeds 90% target) ✅
- H2: `assistant-behavior.mdc` → visible gate output (Checkpoint 1: 100% visibility; optional continuation)
- H3: visible query output ("Checked capabilities.mdc...") (implemented; optional monitoring)

**What's Complete**:

- ✅ All Discovery work (0.1-0.6): Analysis of 25 conditional rules, scalability study, pre-test prep
- ✅ All Review work (R.1-R.2): Test plans validated, premature completion root causes analyzed
- ✅ All Rule Improvements (15.0-20.0): 6 improvements applied to 4 rule files
- ✅ **Phase 6A: H1 Validation** — 30 commits analyzed; 100% compliance validated (+26 points, exceeds 90% target)
- ✅ Phase 6C: Slash commands runtime routing wrong (design mismatch); prompt templates unexplored; testing paradox validated
- ✅ **Phase 6D: Synthesis** — Decision tree created, 25 rules categorized, scalable patterns documented
- ✅ **Phase 6F: Documentation** — Structure reorganized (8 → 5 root files), Gap #12 documented
- ✅ New project created: assistant-self-testing-limits (testing paradox + platform constraints)
- ✅ Meta-findings: **16 gaps** documented (Gaps #1-16) — 9 violations validate enforcement patterns
- ✅ **Findings reorganized** — Extracted to individual files per investigation-structure.mdc (484 → 216 lines)

**Next Steps**:

1. ✅ H1 validation complete (100% compliance)
2. ✅ Synthesis complete (decision tree + 25-rule categorization done)
3. ✅ Structure reorganized (files in correct locations)
4. ✅ Gap #12 documented (self-improve blind spot)
5. ⏸️ Final summary (high-level recommendations document)
6. ⏸️ User review and approval for completion

**Key Insights**:

- **H1 validated at 100%**: AlwaysApply highly effective for critical rules (74% → 100%, +26 points)
- **Decision tree created**: When to use AlwaysApply vs visible gates vs routing vs CI/linting
- **25 rules categorized**: 5-10 AlwaysApply candidates, 5-7 visible gate candidates, 10-12 conditional
- AlwaysApply works for ~20 critical rules but doesn't scale to 44 (+97% context cost)
- Slash commands runtime routing wrong; prompt templates unexplored
- Testing paradox validated: Real usage > prospective testing
- **16 meta-findings** validate enforcement patterns through lived experience (Gaps #1-16, 9 violations)
- **Findings reorganized**: Individual gap files per investigation-structure.mdc (README 484 → 216 lines)
- **Phase 6G proposed**: 7 rule improvements (25+ sub-tasks) from meta-findings
