# Session Summary: 2025-10-16

**Duration**: ~1.5 hours  
**Phase**: Phase 6C (Slash Commands Experiment)  
**Outcome**: Slash commands discovered NOT VIABLE; testing paradox validated

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Implemented Slash Commands Pattern

- Created `.cursor/rules/git-slash-commands.mdc` with enforcement protocol
- Updated `intent-routing.mdc` with highest-priority routing
- Defined mandatory commands: `/commit`, `/pr`, `/branch`, `/pr-update`
- Rules validation passed

### 2. Discovered Design Mismatch (Then Overcorrected - Gap #10)

**Critical finding**: Cursor's `/` prefix is for **prompt templates**, not runtime message routing

- User attempted `/status` → Cursor created `.cursor/commands/status`
- This is correct Cursor behavior (per [Cursor 1.6 changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/1-6))
- Our implementation assumed runtime routing (design mismatch)

**Initial conclusion** (wrong): "Slash commands cannot work" / "NOT VIABLE"

**User correction** (Gap #10): "We did not prove that slash commands were not viable. We only proved that we weren't using them correctly."

**Corrected conclusion**:
- ❌ Runtime routing approach doesn't work
- ✅ Cursor's prompt template design could still be viable
- 📝 Unexplored: Would templates like `.cursor/commands/commit.md` improve compliance?

**Lesson**: Implementation failure ≠ feature non-viability; read platform docs first

**Time saved**: ~8-12 hours of Phase 3 testing (runtime routing would have all failed)

### 3. Created New Project: assistant-self-testing-limits

**Purpose**: Document testing paradox and valid measurement strategies

**Key artifacts**:

- `erd.md` — Testing paradox scope and requirements
- `README.md` — Project overview
- `platform-constraints.md` — Detailed analysis with Cursor docs references

**Core finding**: Assistants cannot objectively measure own behavioral compliance without observer bias

### 4. Captured Meta-Findings

**Gap #7: Documentation-before-execution pattern**

- Asked "which execution mode?" before documenting test protocol
- User: "That should probably be a self-improvement trigger"
- Resolution: Added process-order trigger to `self-improve.mdc`

**Gap #8: Testing paradox**

- Realized prospective self-testing creates observer bias
- Created assistant-self-testing-limits project
- Validated by real usage finding platform constraint

**Gap #9: Changeset policy violation (two-part)**

- Part 1: Created PR without changeset
- Part 2: Added changeset but forgot to remove `skip-changeset` label
- Required TWO user corrections
- Demonstrates: even conscious awareness doesn't prevent violations

## Decisions Made

### Slash Commands: Runtime Routing Wrong; Prompt Templates Unexplored

**What we proved**:

1. ❌ Runtime routing doesn't work: `/` triggers Cursor's template system
2. ✅ Platform design: `/command` loads `.cursor/commands/command.md` template

**What we didn't prove** (Gap #10):
- Whether prompt templates improve compliance
- Whether explicit templates help user discoverability
- Whether this approach scales

**Corrected conclusion**: 
- ❌ Abandoned: Runtime routing (platform mismatch)
- 📝 Unexplored: Prompt templates (could still be viable)
- ✅ Current: H1 (alwaysApply) at 96% (target >90%)

### Testing Approach: Real Usage Over Prospective Trials

**Validation**:

- One 30-second usage attempt found fundamental constraint
- Would have wasted 8-12 hours on 50 test trials
- Confirms: retrospective analysis > prospective self-testing

## Investigation Progress Update

**Before session**: ~40% complete (Discovery, Review, Rule Improvements done; awaiting H1 validation)

**After session**: ~50% complete (+ Phase 6C complete)

**What changed**:

- Phase 6C: READY → NOT VIABLE (platform constraint discovered)
- Testing paradox: THEORETICAL → VALIDATED (real usage confirmed)
- Meta-findings: Gaps #6 → Gaps #9 (+3 new gaps)
- New project created: assistant-self-testing-limits

**What's next**:

- Continue passive monitoring (H1, H2, H3)
- Accumulate 12-22 more commits
- Synthesize findings (Phase 6D)
- Final summary

## Key Learnings

### 1. Read Platform Docs First

Cost without reading: ~6 hours (implementation + test design)  
Cost with reading: 10 minutes  
Savings: 5 hours 50 minutes

**Lesson**: Check official documentation before implementing platform features

### 2. Real Usage > Prospective Testing

One user attempt: 30 seconds → found fundamental constraint  
50 planned trials: 8-12 hours → would have all failed

**Lesson**: Test in production; don't over-plan

### 3. Meta-Validation Works

While investigating rule enforcement:

- Violated documentation-first pattern (Gap #7)
- Missed testing paradox constraint (Gap #8)
- Violated changeset policy twice (Gap #9)

**Lesson**: The investigation validated itself - rules are easy to violate even when highly aware

### 4. Partial Fixes Common

Gap #9 required two corrections:

1. Add changeset
2. Remove label

**Lesson**: Multi-step fixes need checklists; automation better than manual

## Metrics

**Efficiency**:

- Context gauge: 3/5 (ok) — moderate rules + loops
- Session productive: 3 major deliverables in 1.5 hours
- Time saved: ~8-12 hours by discovering constraint early

**Investigation**:

- Baseline: 74% script usage → Current: 96% (+22 points)
- Target: >90% compliance (likely achieved)
- Meta-findings: 9 gaps total (6 from previous sessions + 3 today)

---

**Status**: Session complete; investigation bookmarked at 50%  
**Next**: Continue normal work; passive monitoring accumulates validation data  
**Timeline**: Synthesis after 12-22 more commits (~1-2 weeks normal usage)
