# H3 Test C Results — Visible Query Output Implementation

**Test**: Hypothesis 3 — Query Protocol Visibility  
**Phase**: Test C (Visible Output Requirement)  
**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Objective

Add explicit output requirement to make query step visible in assistant responses.

---

## Implementation

### Change 1: assistant-git-usage.mdc

**Modified**: Script-First Default section (lines 15-30)

**Added**:
```markdown
2. **OUTPUT result**: "Checked capabilities.mdc for [operation]: [found <path> | not found]"
   - Example: "Checked capabilities.mdc for commit: found `.cursor/scripts/git-commit.sh`"
   - Example: "Checked capabilities.mdc for status: not found"
```

**Effect**: Makes query output explicit requirement (not advisory)

### Change 2: assistant-behavior.mdc

**Status**: Already present (line 191)

**Existing text**:
```markdown
- **Scripts**: before git/terminal commands, checked capabilities.mdc for repo scripts; 
  used script if available. OUTPUT: "Checked capabilities.mdc for [operation]: [found <path> | not found]"
```

**Finding**: Send gate already includes this check!

---

## Pattern Match: H2 Test D

| Aspect | H2: Send Gate | H3: Query Protocol |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Baseline visibility** | 0% (silent) | 0% (silent) |
| **Change applied** | Added "OUTPUT this checklist" | Added "OUTPUT result" |
| **Implementation** | Modified assistant-behavior.mdc | Modified both rules |
| **Expected result** | ~100% visibility | ~100% visibility |
| **Pattern** | Explicit OUTPUT → forcing function | Explicit OUTPUT → forcing function |

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Query Now Visible (Expected)

**Observations**:
- Assistant responses include "Checked capabilities.mdc for [operation]: [result]"
- Before git commands: "Checked capabilities.mdc for commit: found..."
- Visibility rate approaches 100%

**Implications**:
- Same pattern as H2 (advisory → explicit OUTPUT = success)
- Query transparency improves accountability
- Users can see that capabilities are being checked

**Validation**:
- Monitor next 10-20 git operations
- Measure visibility rate
- Compare to 0% baseline

### Scenario 2: Query Still Not Visible (Unlikely)

**Observations**:
- No "Checked capabilities.mdc" output
- Visibility remains 0%

**Implications**:
- Different mechanism than H2 (unexpected)
- May need platform-specific adjustment
- Investigate why explicit requirement doesn't work

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate why requirement ignored
- Consider alternative visibility approaches

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### Next 10 Git Operations

**Track for each operation**:

```yaml
operation_id: 1
operation_type: "commit"
query_visible: true/false
query_output: "[exact text or 'none']"
script_found: true/false
script_used: true/false
consistency: true/false # did behavior match query result?
```

### Success Criteria

**Primary**: Query visibility ≥90% (10+ operations)

**Secondary**: 
- Query results accurate (matches actual script availability)
- Behavior consistent with results (uses script if found)

### Checkpoint After 10 Operations

**If visibility ≥90%**:
- ✅ H3 validated (same pattern as H2)
- Document success
- Include in final synthesis

**If visibility <90%**:
- Investigate gaps
- Refine requirements
- Consider alternative approaches

---

## Combined H1+H2+H3 Hypothesis

**Three explicit requirements working together**:

1. **H1**: Git-usage rule always in context (`alwaysApply: true`)
2. **H2**: Visible send gate checklist (accountability)
3. **H3**: Visible query output (transparency)

**Expected Combined Effect**: >90% overall compliance

**Validation**: Monitor passive accumulation over next 2-3 weeks

---

## Implementation Notes

### Why This Should Work

**Pattern from H2**:
- Advisory requirements → silent/ignored
- Explicit OUTPUT requirements → 100% compliance

**This implementation**:
- Two locations: rule itself + send gate
- Explicit OUTPUT with examples
- Consistent with H2 successful pattern

### Risk: Observer Effect

**Concern**: Explicit visibility may create observer effect (assistant knows it's being watched)

**Mitigation**: 
- Natural usage only (no artificial test scenarios)
- Measure over longer period (20+ operations)
- Compare to baseline behavior (not just visibility)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor passively** — Accumulate data during normal work
2. **Checkpoint after 10 operations** — Measure visibility rate
3. **Validate** — Compare to 0% baseline
4. **Document** — Include in final synthesis if successful

---

**Test C Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Next**: Monitor visibility during normal git operations  
**Expected**: 0% → ~100% (matching H2 pattern)  
**Validation Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (passive accumulation)
