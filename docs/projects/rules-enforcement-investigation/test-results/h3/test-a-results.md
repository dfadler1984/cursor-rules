# H3 Test A Results — Baseline Query Visibility

**Test**: Hypothesis 3 — Query Protocol Visibility  
**Phase**: Test A (Baseline)  
**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Method**: Retrospective analysis

---

## Objective

Determine if the query step ("Is there a script in capabilities.mdc for this operation?") produces visible output in assistant responses.

---

## Method

**Retrospective Analysis**:
- Searched git log for evidence of query output
- Keywords: "capabilities", "Checked", "script-first"
- Timeframe: Last 20 commits

**Expected Evidence** (if query is visible):
- "Checked capabilities.mdc for [operation]: [result]"
- Mentions of capabilities.mdc in responses
- Status output like "Found git-commit.sh" or "No script found"

---

## Results

**Query Visibility**: **0%** (0 instances found)

**Evidence Search**:
```bash
git log --all --oneline --grep="capabilities\|Checked\|script-first" -20
```

**Findings**:
- No commit messages contain query output
- No visible evidence of "Checked capabilities.mdc"
- Scripts ARE being used (~74% baseline), but query step is silent

**Commits mentioning scripts**:
- `7b7e5e6 feat(rules): add script-first enforcement` (rule creation, not usage)
- Several mentions in context of rule updates

---

## Interpretation

### Query Is Likely Executed But Silent

**Evidence**:
- Script usage rate ~74% (from check-script-usage.sh)
- Scripts like `git-commit.sh`, `pr-create.sh` ARE being used
- But no visible "checking capabilities" step

**Conclusion**: Query happens internally but produces no output

**Pattern Match**: Same as H2 Test A
- Advisory requirement ("check capabilities") → silent execution
- No forcing function to make it visible

---

## Comparison to H2 Test A

| Metric | H2: Send Gate | H3: Query Protocol |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Advisory requirement | "Verify checklist" | "Query capabilities" |
| Baseline visibility | 0% (0/17) | 0% (0/20 analyzed) |
| Behavior happening? | Yes (silently) | Yes (scripts used) |
| Pattern | Advisory → invisible | Advisory → invisible |

**Finding**: Same pattern as H2 — advisory requirements execute silently

---

## Next Step

**Proceed to Test C**: Add explicit output requirement

**Hypothesis**: Just like H2, requiring "OUTPUT [result]" will make query visible

**Expected Result**: 0% → ~100% visibility (matching H2 Test D improvement)

---

**Test A Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Finding**: Query visibility 0% (baseline established)  
**Next**: Implement Test C (visible output requirement)
