# H1 Validation Results: Conditional Attachment Fix

**Test**: Hypothesis 1 — Conditional attachment (`alwaysApply: false`) causes rule violations  
**Fix Applied**: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true` (2025-10-15)  
**Validation Period**: 2025-10-15 to 2025-10-16  
**Validation Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

---

## Summary

**Result**: Fix improved compliance from 74% to 80% but did not reach 90% target.

**Conclusion**: `alwaysApply: true` helps but is NOT sufficient alone. Additional enforcement patterns needed for remaining 20% gap.

## Analysis

### What Worked

1. **AlwaysApply does improve compliance**

   - Script usage: +6 points
   - TDD compliance: +11 points
   - Overall: +6 points

2. **Measurement framework validated**

   - All scripts working correctly
   - Baseline vs current comparison reliable
   - Dashboard provides clear visibility

3. **Direction is correct**
   - Every metric improved or stayed stable (except branch naming)
   - Upward trend visible

### What Didn't Work

1. **Improvement insufficient**

   - 6-11 point improvements fall short of 20+ point gap to target
   - 80% → need 90%: 10-point gap remains

2. **Branch naming regressed slightly**

   - 62% → 60% (not significant, within measurement noise)
   - Suggests alwaysApply alone doesn't help all rules equally

3. **TDD gap remains large**
   - 83% → need 95%: 12-point gap
   - Pre-edit gate may not be executing consistently

### Why Only Partial Success?

**Hypothesis**: AlwaysApply ensures rule is loaded, but doesn't guarantee:

1. **Execution of specific protocols** (e.g., "Check capabilities.mdc")
2. **Pre-edit gate enforcement** (TDD still at 83%)
3. **Send gate effectiveness** (violations still occur)

**Evidence from other metrics**:

- TDD improved but still <95% → suggests pre-edit gate not fully effective
- Branch naming stable/slight regression → unaffected by git-usage fix
- Overall improvement modest → suggests systemic enforcement gaps remain

## Decision per Monitoring Protocol

**Protocol guidance for 80-89% script usage**:

> ⚠️ Partial success  
> Investigate remaining gaps  
> Consider H3 + slash commands

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. ✅ **H1 validated** — AlwaysApply helps (6-11 point improvement)
2. ⏭️ **Execute H3** — Test if visible query output improves compliance further
3. ⏭️ **Analyze H2 data** — Review send gate visibility and effectiveness
4. 🤔 **Reconsider slash commands** — Prompt templates approach still unexplored
5. 📊 **Synthesize patterns** — Create decision tree for enforcement approaches

---

## Discrepancy: Preliminary vs Validated Results

**Preliminary claim** (2025-10-16 session notes):

- "96% compliance"
- "Highly effective"

**Validated result** (21 commits, full analysis):

- 80% compliance
- Partial success

**Explanation**:

- Preliminary: measured last 8 commits only (small sample)
- Validated: measured last 100 commits (includes pre-fix and post-fix)
- Lesson: Small samples can show optimistic trends; need larger samples

## Implications for 25 Conditional Rules

**Key Finding**: AlwaysApply improves compliance but doesn't solve all enforcement gaps.

**For the 25 conditional rules**:

1. **Critical rules** (5 rules) → Consider alwaysApply

   - assistant-git-usage ✅ (already applied)
   - tdd-first-js, tdd-first-sh, testing, refactoring

2. **High-risk rules** → Need additional patterns

   - Visible query output (H3)
   - Improved send gate (H2)
   - Intent routing improvements

3. **Medium/Low rules** → Conditional attachment likely sufficient
   - Intent routing works well for guidance/planning rules
   - On-demand rules don't need always-apply

**Scalability assessment**:

- AlwaysApply for 5 critical rules: ~+10k tokens (~15% context increase)
- AlwaysApply for all 25 rules: +33k tokens (+50% context increase) — NOT scalable
- Conclusion: Need multiple enforcement patterns, not just alwaysApply

## Next Actions

### Immediate

1. ✅ Document H1 results (this file)
2. ⏭️ Review H2 monitoring data (send gate visibility)
3. ⏭️ Review H3 monitoring data (query visibility)
4. ⏭️ Decide: is 80% sufficient, or execute additional tests?

### Phase 6D: Synthesis

1. Create enforcement decision tree
2. Categorize 25 conditional rules by enforcement pattern needed
3. Document scalable patterns (not just alwaysApply)
4. Provide recommendations for each rule category

### Optional

- Execute H3 fully if query visibility shows promise
- Reconsider prompt templates approach for slash commands
- Deeper investigation into TDD pre-edit gate effectiveness

---

**Status**: H1 VALIDATED — Partial success (80% vs 90% target)  
**Recommendation**: Proceed to synthesis; execute H3 if seeking >90%  
**Timeline**: Synthesis ~4-6 hours; H3 optional ~2-4 hours
