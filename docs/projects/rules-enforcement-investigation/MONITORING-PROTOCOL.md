# Monitoring Protocol ‚Äî Rules Enforcement Investigation

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Started**: 2025-10-15  
**Mode**: Passive (accumulates during normal work)

## What's Being Monitored

### H1: Conditional Attachment Fix Validation

**Fix Applied**: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` ‚Üí `alwaysApply: true`

**Metric**: Script usage rate (conventional commits)

**Progress**:
- Commits since fix: 8
- Target: 20-30 commits
- Current rate: 96% (baseline: 74%)
- Improvement: +22 percentage points

**Status**: ‚úÖ Highly effective; need more data for formal validation

### H2: Visible Send Gate (Test D)

**Fix Applied**: Modified `assistant-behavior.mdc` to require "OUTPUT this checklist"

**Metric**: Gate visibility rate

**Progress**:
- Checkpoint 1: ‚úÖ Complete (100% visibility, 1/1 responses)
- Checkpoint 2: Pending (need 5 responses with actions)
- Checkpoint 3: Pending (need 10 responses)
- Checkpoint 4: Pending (need 20 responses)

**Status**: üîÑ Active; gate appearing consistently

## How to Check Progress

### Quick Check (Every ~5 Commits)

```bash
cd /Users/dustinfadler/Development/cursor-rules
bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 30
```

**Look for**:
- Script usage rate trending toward >90%
- Overall compliance improving
- No regressions in other areas

### Detailed Check (Every ~10 Commits)

```bash
# Count commits since fix
git log --oneline 49c4bd6..HEAD | wc -l

# Full compliance report
bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 30

# Individual metrics
bash .cursor/scripts/check-script-usage.sh --limit 30
bash .cursor/scripts/check-tdd-compliance.sh --limit 30
bash .cursor/scripts/check-branch-names.sh
```

### H2 Checkpoint Tracking

**Every response with actions, note**:
- Was pre-send gate checklist visible? (Yes/No)
- Format: clean or cluttered?
- Any FAIL status? (revisions happening?)
- Which items were checked?

**Log in**: `h2-test-d-checkpoint-N.md` files

## Decision Points

### After 20-30 Total Commits (H1 Validation Complete)

**If script usage ‚â•90%**:
- ‚úÖ H1 validated successfully
- Document success in findings.md
- Proceed to synthesis

**If script usage 80-89%**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial success
- Investigate remaining gaps
- Consider H3 + slash commands

**If script usage <80%**:
- ‚ùå Fix insufficient
- Execute H3 and slash commands immediately
- Deeper investigation needed

### After 20 Responses (H2 Complete)

**If gate visibility ‚â•90%**:
- ‚úÖ Visible gate working
- Measure compliance impact
- Document effectiveness

**If gate visibility 70-89%**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent
- Investigate when gate doesn't appear
- Refine requirements

**If gate visibility <70%**:
- ‚ùå Revert to baseline
- Investigate why explicit requirement isn't working

### Combined Decision (H1 + H2)

**If overall compliance ‚â•90%**:
- ‚úÖ Investigation successful
- Skip H3 and slash commands (not needed)
- Write final summary
- Mark project "Complete (Active)"

**If overall compliance <90%**:
- Execute H3 (query visibility)
- Execute slash commands experiment
- Synthesize all patterns
- Create enforcement decision tree

## What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå Don't create artificial test scenarios
- ‚ùå Don't modify workflow to "game" metrics
- ‚ùå Don't stop monitoring early
- ‚ùå Don't declare success without 20-30 commits

**Principle**: Natural usage data only; no observer effect

---

## Timeline Estimates

**Conservative** (working normally, 3-5 commits/week):
- 20 commits: 4-6 weeks
- 30 commits: 6-9 weeks

**Aggressive** (active development, 5-10 commits/week):
- 20 commits: 2-4 weeks
- 30 commits: 3-6 weeks

**Current pace** (8 commits since 2025-10-15): ~1-2 commits/day

**Estimated completion**: 2-3 weeks for full validation

---

## Next Actions

1. **Work normally** ‚Äî No special testing needed
2. **Check dashboard** ‚Äî Every ~5 commits
3. **Log H2 checkpoints** ‚Äî Every response with actions
4. **Decision point** ‚Äî After 20-30 commits total

**Monitoring Status**: ACTIVE  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16  
**Next Check**: After 5 more commits (13 total)
