# Gap #8: Testing Paradox — Assistant Cannot Objectively Self-Test

**Discovered**: 2025-10-16  
**Context**: Attempting slash commands Phase 3 testing  
**Severity**: High (methodology limitation)

---

## Issue

Cannot measure own behavioral compliance without observer bias

## Evidence

Slash commands Phase 3 would require issuing test requests and observing responses - but conscious testing changes behavior

## Analogy

"Can you test whether you'll check your blind spot?" - the act of testing changes the behavior

## Impact

Some experiments are fundamentally unmeasurable via self-testing; prospective trials invalid

## Valid Alternatives

- Historical analysis (retrospective)
- Natural usage monitoring (passive)
- User-observed validation
- External validation (CI)

## Pattern

Retrospective > prospective for self-testing; external validation when objectivity required

## Resolution

✅ **Sub-Project Created**: `assistant-self-testing-limits`

Created new project to document:

- Testing paradox details
- Valid measurement strategies
- Platform constraints with official Cursor references

## Validation

2025-10-16 - User attempted `/status`, discovered Cursor UI intercepts `/` prefix; slash commands not viable.

**One real usage attempt found fundamental constraint that 50 test trials would have missed.**

Testing paradox confirmed: **real usage > prospective testing**.
