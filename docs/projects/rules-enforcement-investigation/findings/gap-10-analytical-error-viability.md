# Gap #10: Conflated Implementation Failure with Feature Non-Viability

**Discovered**: 2025-10-16  
**Context**: Slash commands documentation  
**Severity**: Medium (analytical error)

---

## Issue

Concluded "slash commands not viable" when only our runtime-routing approach failed; didn't consider Cursor's actual design (prompt templates)

## Evidence

Documentation said "Slash Commands: NOT VIABLE" when we only proved runtime routing doesn't work, not that prompt templates won't work

## User Correction

"We did not prove that slash commands were not viable. We only proved that we weren't using them correctly."

## Impact

- False conclusion
- Dismissed potentially viable approach
- Analytical error in investigation

## What We Proved

❌ Runtime routing via `/commit` in messages doesn't work (Cursor intercepts `/` for UI)

## What We Didn't Prove

Whether Cursor's prompt template design could improve compliance

## Actual Cursor Design

Per [Cursor 1.6 docs](https://cursor.com/changelog/1-6):

`/command` → loads template from `.cursor/commands/command.md` → sends template content to assistant

## Unexplored Approach

Create templates like `.cursor/commands/commit.md` containing "Use git-commit.sh to create conventional commit"

## Meta-Observation

Made analytical leap from "approach A failed" to "feature not viable"; investigation's own reasoning error

## Pattern

**Implementation failure ≠ feature non-viability**

Distinguish "how we tried" from "whether it can work"

## Files Affected

- slash-commands-decision.md
- Session summary
- findings
- tasks
- README

All said "NOT VIABLE" incorrectly

## Resolution

✅ Corrected all documentation; created prompt-templates-exploration.md for future consideration

**Status**: Prompt templates remain unexplored (lower priority with H1 at 100%)
