# Gap #22 Quick Analysis: Immediate Findings

**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Analysis Type**: Quick pattern scan across all documented gaps  
**Purpose**: Fast evidence gathering for "why TDD violations persist"

---

## Evidence from All Gaps (#1-22)

### Violations with AlwaysApply Rules Loaded

| Gap | Rule                    | alwaysApply | Violation                | Context                   |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| #9  | assistant-git-usage.mdc | ✅ Yes      | Changeset missing (3x)   | PR creation               |
| #15 | assistant-git-usage.mdc | ✅ Yes      | Changeset label wrong    | PR creation               |
| #17 | self-improve.mdc        | ✅ Yes      | Reactive not proactive   | Documentation pattern     |
| #18 | assistant-git-usage.mdc | ✅ Yes      | Script-first bypass      | Used curl vs pr-labels.sh |
| #22 | tdd-first.mdc           | ✅ Yes      | **No tests before impl** | **Shell script creation** |

**Finding**: **5 violations occurred WITH alwaysApply rules loaded**

**Conclusion**: alwaysApply loads rules but doesn't prevent violations

---

### Violations with Visible Gates

| Gap | Gate Type                | Gate Visible      | Violation      | Outcome                    |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| #15 | Pre-send changeset check | ✅ Yes            | Still violated | Gate visible, not blocking |
| #17 | Proactive documentation  | ✅ Yes            | Still reactive | Gate shown, still bypassed |
| #22 | TDD pre-edit gate        | ✅ Yes (in rules) | Still no tests | Gate defined, not enforced |

**Finding**: **All 3 recent gaps had visible gates that were bypassed**

**Conclusion**: Visible gates provide transparency but not prevention

---

### Pattern: Execution vs Routing

**Routing failures** (wrong rules attached):

- None in recent gaps #15-22
- Routing-optimization achieved 100% accuracy

**Execution failures** (right rules loaded, but violated):

- Gap #15: Rule loaded, still violated
- Gap #17: Rule loaded, still violated
- Gap #18: Rule loaded, still violated
- Gap #22: **Rule loaded, still violated**

**Finding**: **Recent failures are 100% execution, 0% routing**

**Conclusion**: Routing optimization successful; execution enforcement is the remaining problem

## Quick Answer: Why TDD Violations Persist

**Root Cause**: **TDD gate is advisory (informational), not blocking (mechanical)**

**Evidence**:

1. **Gate text from `assistant-behavior.mdc`**:

   ```markdown
   ## TDD pre-edit gate (all maintained sources)

   Before editing any maintained source, provide a TDD confirmation...
   ```

   - Says "provide confirmation" (show info)
   - Doesn't say "refuse to edit" or "fail if missing"
   - No mechanical block specified

2. **Behavior observed**:

   - Gate defined in rules ✅
   - Rules loaded (alwaysApply) ✅
   - Still created file without tests ❌
   - No mechanical prevention occurred

3. **Pattern across gaps**:
   - 11 violations documented
   - Many had alwaysApply rules
   - Many had visible gates
   - **None had blocking enforcement**
   - **0 violations stopped mid-action**

**Conclusion**: Advisory guidance + visibility ≠ mechanical prevention

## What Would Prevent TDD Violations?

### Option 1: Blocking Pre-Send Gate (Recommended)

**Mechanism**: Pre-send gate FAILS if source file created without tests

**Implementation**:

```markdown
Pre-Send Gate:

- [ ] TDD: spec updated? (if impl edits)
  - Check: If creating/editing _.sh → _.test.sh exists or being created
  - Check: If creating/editing _.ts → _.test.ts|\*.spec.ts exists or being created
  - If NO test file: Mark gate as FAIL
  - If FAIL: DO NOT SEND MESSAGE, show error, require revision
```

**Impact**: Mechanical prevention (cannot send message without tests)

---

### Option 2: File Pairing Validation

**Mechanism**: Detect file creation patterns and require pairs

**Implementation**:

- Tool call watcher: If `write` or `search_replace` on `*.sh` → check `*.test.sh`
- If test file missing AND no test file being created in same batch → FAIL
- Refuse to execute tool call

**Impact**: Prevention at tool invocation (earlier than pre-send)

---

### Option 3: CI Enforcement (External)

**Mechanism**: CI rejects PRs without test coverage

**Implementation**:

- Coverage gate: Require coverage >0 for new files
- Test file presence: Check `*.sh` has `*.test.sh`
- Block merge until tests added

**Impact**: Late-stage prevention (PR review, not development)

---

## Recommendation

**Primary**: **Option 1 (Blocking Pre-Send Gate)** + **Option 3 (CI Enforcement)**

**Rationale**:

1. Pre-send gate catches violations immediately (before message sent)
2. CI provides external validation (can't bypass with rule changes)
3. Combined: Development-time prevention + PR-time safety net
4. Proven pattern: Gap #15 showed visible gates insufficient, blocking gates needed

**Not recommended**: Option 2 alone (too early, might break legitimate workflows)

---

## Implementation Estimate

**Pre-send gate blocking**:

- Update `assistant-behavior.mdc`: Add file pairing check to pre-send gate (~30 min)
- Specify FAIL behavior: Refuse to send, show error (~15 min)
- Test with intentional violation (~15 min)
- **Total**: ~1 hour

**CI coverage gate**:

- Add coverage check to GitHub Actions (~30 min)
- Test with PR (~15 min)
- **Total**: ~45 min

**Combined**: ~2 hours for complete enforcement

---

## Validation Plan

**Test blocking gate**:

1. Attempt to create `test-script.sh` without `test-script.test.sh`
2. **Expected**: Pre-send gate FAILS, message not sent, error shown
3. Create `test-script.test.sh` first
4. **Expected**: Pre-send gate PASSES, message sent

**Monitor for violations**:

1. Track file creations for 1 week
2. Count TDD violations (should be 0)
3. Count false positives (legitimate files blocked)
4. **Target**: 0 violations, <1% false positives

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ✅ Document Gap #22 finding
2. ✅ Create investigation plan
3. ✅ Quick analysis (this file)
4. [ ] Fix project-archive-ready.sh tests (complete TDD cycle)

### Investigation

1. [ ] Update rules-enforcement-investigation findings/README.md with Gap #22
2. [ ] Add Gap #22 tasks to rules-enforcement-investigation tasks.md
3. [ ] Design blocking pre-send gate for TDD
4. [ ] Implement and test

**Status**: Quick analysis complete  
**Root Cause Identified**: TDD gate advisory (informational), not blocking (mechanical)  
**Solution**: Add blocking pre-send gate for file pairing validation  
**Confidence**: High (validates Gap #15 finding: visible gates insufficient)
