# Gap #2: Self-Improvement Pattern Detection Needs Strengthening

**Discovered**: 2025-10-15  
**Context**: Handoff discussion  
**Severity**: Medium (missed investigation evidence)

---

## Issue

Observed rule gaps not proactively flagged as investigation evidence

## Evidence

Project-lifecycle gap noticed but not added to scope until user prompted

## Impact

Missed opportunity to capture first-class data during active investigation

## Recommendation

During rule investigations, treat observed issues as first-class data

## Resolution

✅ **Applied in Phase 1** (Task 20.0)

Updated `self-improve.mdc`:

- Added "Special Case: Rule Investigations" section
- Added "Notice gap → Document immediately" with do/don't examples
- Cited evidence: Project-lifecycle gap noticed but not added to scope until user prompted
- Provided what happened vs what should happen comparison
