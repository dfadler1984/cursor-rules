# Findings: Rules Enforcement Investigation

**Project**: rules-enforcement-investigation  
**Status**: ACTIVE — MONITORING (Phase 6A/6B)  
**Completion**: ~50%  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16

---

## Status Update (2025-10-16)

**What's Complete**:

- ✅ Discovery, Review, Rule Improvements (Tasks 0.1-0.6, R.1-R.2, 15.0-20.0)
- ✅ H1 Validated: AlwaysApply improves compliance (+6-11 points) but insufficient alone
- ✅ Phase 6C: Slash commands runtime routing wrong; prompt templates unexplored
- ✅ Meta-findings: 10 gaps documented (Gaps #1-10)

**Current Status**: H1 validation complete (80% compliance vs 90% target); H2/H3 monitoring active

**Validation Results**: 21 commits analyzed — fix works but only achieves 80% (target: 90%)

## H1 Finding: AlwaysApply Helps But Insufficient Alone

**Factor Identified**: Conditional attachment (`alwaysApply: false` on git-usage rule)

**Fix Applied**: Changed `assistant-git-usage.mdc` to `alwaysApply: true` (2025-10-15)

**Validation**: 21 commits analyzed (2025-10-15 to 2025-10-16)

**Results**:

- ✅ Script usage: 74% → 80% (+6 points)
- ✅ TDD compliance: 72% → 83% (+11 points)
- ⚠️ Overall: 74% vs 90% target (16-point gap remains)

**Evidence**:

- Meta-test proved rules CAN work when alwaysApply: true
- Real usage shows improvement but not sufficient alone
- 80% compliance indicates additional enforcement patterns needed

**Scalability Confirmed**:

- ✅ AlwaysApply for 5 critical rules: feasible (~+10k tokens)
- ❌ AlwaysApply for all 25 conditional rules: NOT scalable (+33k tokens, +50% context)
- 🎯 Need multiple enforcement patterns, not just alwaysApply

---

## Research Questions: Status

### Answered

- **Q3**: How to measure compliance objectively?  
  → ✅ **Automated checkers** (built, validated, working)

- **Q4**: Why did violations occur?  
  → ✅ **Conditional attachment is primary factor** (validated: 74% → 80% improvement)
  → ⚠️ **But not only factor** (80% vs 90% target shows additional gaps)

### Partially Answered

- **Q1**: Are rules constraints or reference material?  
  → ⚠️ **Both**: AlwaysApply rules constrain (80% compliance) but don't guarantee perfect compliance
  → 🔄 Conditional rules still depend on routing accuracy

- **Q2**: What creates forcing functions?  
  → ✅ **AlwaysApply** is strongest (validated: +6-11 points)
  → 🔄 Pre-send gates: H2 monitoring active (preliminary: gate visible but effectiveness TBD)
  → 🔄 Query visibility: H3 monitoring active

### Deferred / Changed Priority

- **Q5**: Do slash commands create better forcing functions?  
  → ⏸️ **Runtime routing wrong** (Cursor uses `/` for prompt templates, not message routing)
  → 📝 **Prompt templates unexplored** (could still improve compliance)
  → 🎯 **Lower priority**: H1 at 80% suggests focusing on H2/H3 first

- **Q6**: Why don't pre-send gates work as well as checkpoints?  
  → 🔄 **H2 monitoring active**: Visible gate implemented, collecting data
  → 📊 Preliminary: gate appears consistently, compliance impact TBD

- **Q7**: Does visible query output improve enforcement?  
  → 🔄 **H3 monitoring active**: Visible query output implemented
  → 📊 Need more git operations to measure impact

## Remaining Work

### Completed ✅

1. ✅ **Validate H1 Fix** (21 commits analyzed)

   - Result: 74% → 80% (+6 points), but below 90% target
   - Conclusion: AlwaysApply helps but insufficient alone

2. ✅ **Complete 6 Rule Improvements** (Tasks 15.0-20.0)

   - All applied to 4 rule files (project-lifecycle, create-erd, generate-tasks, self-improve)

3. ✅ **Slash Commands Investigation**
   - Runtime routing: not viable (platform design mismatch)
   - Prompt templates: unexplored, lower priority given H1 at 80%

### In Progress 🔄

4. **Hypothesis 2: Send Gate Enforcement** (H2 monitoring active)

   - Visible gate implemented and appearing consistently

   - Visible query output implemented
   - Need more git operations to measure impact
   - Status: Passive accumulation

### Required for Completion 📋

6. **Synthesize Scalable Patterns** (Phase 6D)

   - Analyze H1 + H2 + H3 results
   - Create enforcement decision tree
   - Categorize 25 conditional rules by pattern needed
   - Document when to use: alwaysApply vs visible gates vs routing

7. **Final Summary**
   - Validated recommendations for all rule types
   - Lessons learned about enforcement patterns
   - Reusable patterns for other Cursor rules repos

## Rule Gaps Discovered During Investigation

**Five rule gaps discovered** (meta-findings about project management rules):

**Pattern observed**: As we cleaned up the investigation, each cleanup step revealed another rule gap. This validates the investigation's finding that rules are easy to violate when process signals are missed.

### 1. Project-lifecycle.mdc unclear on completion states

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on "complete but not archived" state
- **Evidence**: Confusion between ERD status, HANDOFF status, and actual completion
- **Impact**: Wasted effort creating/consolidating docs, unclear final-summary timing
- **Recommendation**: Clarify completion states, standardize transition docs
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during document consolidation

### 2. Self-improvement pattern detection needs strengthening

- **Issue**: Observed rule gaps not proactively flagged as investigation evidence
- **Evidence**: Project-lifecycle gap noticed but not added to scope until user prompted
- **Impact**: Missed opportunity to capture first-class data during active investigation
- **Recommendation**: During rule investigations, treat observed issues as first-class data
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during handoff discussion

### 3. Task document structure not clearly defined

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on what belongs in tasks.md vs ERD vs other docs
- **Evidence**: tasks.md accumulated findings, questions, success criteria (152 lines non-task content)
- **Impact**: Tasks file became bloated with content that should be in ERD/README
- **Recommendation**: Define tasks.md as phase sections with checklists only; all other content in ERD
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during tasks.md cleanup

### 4. ERD vs tasks separation unclear for acceptance criteria

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on whether acceptance criteria checklists belong in ERD or tasks
- **Evidence**: ERD section 5 had acceptance criteria as checklists (should be in tasks.md)
- **Impact**: Duplication of checklist structure across files, unclear source of truth
- **Recommendation**: ERD describes acceptance criteria as narrative/requirements; tasks.md contains the actual checklists
- **Pattern**: ERD = requirements/what, tasks.md = execution/status
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during ERD review

### 5. ERD scope not clearly defined

- **Issue**: ERD accumulates findings, retrospective, and detailed execution plans beyond requirements
- **Evidence**: ERD section 11 (73 lines) contained findings/carryovers, not requirements; section 10 had detailed week-by-week timeline
- **Impact**: ERD becomes bloated (441 lines), hard to scan for actual requirements
- **Recommendation**: Define ERD scope clearly (requirements only); create separate findings.md for retrospective/outcomes
- **Pattern**: ERD = requirements/approach, findings.md = outcomes/retrospective, tasks.md = execution/status
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during ERD review

### 6. No guidance on summary document proliferation

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on when multiple summary documents are needed vs single entry point
- **Evidence**: Created 3 summary documents (README, BREAKTHROUGH, EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY) with 70-80% content overlap (all telling same story)
- **Impact**: Document proliferation (15 files), redundancy, unclear which doc is authoritative, wasted consolidation effort
- **Recommendation**: Define standard entry point (README.md); avoid multiple summaries unless distinct audiences require different formats
- **Pattern**: README.md = single entry point with navigation; specialized summaries only when justified by distinct audience needs
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during summary consolidation

### 7. Documentation-before-execution pattern not automatic

- **Issue**: Asked "which execution mode?" before documenting test protocol; user had to point out protocol should be documented regardless
- **Evidence**: 2025-10-16 slash commands testing - proposed 3 execution modes but didn't document protocol first
- **Impact**: Violated plan-first principle; required user correction; missed opportunity to model good practice during investigation
- **Meta-observation**: Even while investigating rule enforcement, violated documentation-first pattern
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen self-improve.mdc to treat "should document first" as first-class trigger, not afterthought
- **Pattern**: Document → then choose execution; not "choose execution, maybe document"
- **Files affected**: `self-improve.mdc`, potentially `spec-driven.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-16 during slash commands Phase 3 setup
- **Resolution**: ✅ Added process-order trigger to self-improve.mdc

### 8. Testing paradox: assistant cannot objectively self-test

- **Issue**: Cannot measure own behavioral compliance without observer bias
- **Evidence**: Slash commands Phase 3 would require issuing test requests and observing responses - but conscious testing changes behavior
- **Impact**: Some experiments are fundamentally unmeasurable via self-testing; prospective trials invalid
- **Analogy**: "Can you test whether you'll check your blind spot?" - the act of testing changes the behavior
- **Valid alternatives**: Historical analysis (retrospective), natural usage monitoring (passive), user-observed validation, external validation (CI)
- **Recommendation**: Created new project `assistant-self-testing-limits` to document valid measurement strategies
- **Pattern**: Retrospective > prospective for self-testing; external validation when objectivity required
- **Files affected**: Test plan template, experiment designs
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-16 when attempting to design slash commands Phase 3 testing
- **Resolution**: Deferred slash commands testing; will rely on H1 validation results (96% current rate)
- **Validation**: 2025-10-16 - User attempted `/status`, discovered Cursor UI intercepts `/` prefix; slash commands not viable. One real usage attempt found fundamental constraint that 50 test trials would have missed. Testing paradox confirmed: real usage > prospective testing.

### 9. Changeset policy violated when creating PR (two-part violation)

- **Issue**: Created PR #132 without changeset and without requesting skip consent; then forgot to remove `skip-changeset` label after adding changeset
- **Evidence**:
  - Part 1: PR created with rule changes but no `.changeset/*.md` file; PR description had unchecked "[ ] Changeset" item
  - Part 2: After adding changeset, left `skip-changeset` label on PR; required second user correction
- **Impact**: Violated changeset default policy; required TWO user corrections; would have bypassed version tracking and CI checks
- **Rule violated**: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → "When preparing a PR that includes code/rules/docs edits, include a Changeset by default"
- **What should have happened**:
  1. Prompt to run `npx changeset` OR create `.changeset/<slug>.md` non-interactively OR ask for explicit skip consent
  2. After adding changeset, remove any `skip-changeset` label and check the checkbox
- **What actually happened**:
  1. Created PR immediately without changeset or consent check
  2. Added changeset but left `skip-changeset` label; updated description but forgot label cleanup
- **Meta-observation**: While investigating rule enforcement and documenting Gaps #1-8, violated another rule TWICE (incomplete fix)
- **Pattern**: Even high awareness of rules doesn't prevent violations; partial fixes require follow-up; automated gates needed
- **Files affected**: Compliance gate checklist in `assistant-behavior.mdc`
- **Discovered**:
  - Part 1: 2025-10-16 immediately after PR #132 creation, user: "I noticed you submit the pr with the skip changeset flag"
  - Part 2: 2025-10-16 after changeset added, user: "You submit the changset, but did not remove the skip changeset label"
- **Resolution**: ✅ Created changeset non-interactively, pushed to PR; ✅ Removed `skip-changeset` label via API

### 10. Conflated implementation failure with feature non-viability

- **Issue**: Concluded "slash commands not viable" when only our runtime-routing approach failed; didn't consider Cursor's actual design (prompt templates)
- **Evidence**: Documentation said "Slash Commands: NOT VIABLE" when we only proved runtime routing doesn't work, not that prompt templates won't work
- **User correction**: "We did not prove that slash commands were not viable. We only proved that we weren't using them correctly."
- **Impact**: False conclusion; dismissed potentially viable approach; analytical error in investigation
- **What we proved**: ❌ Runtime routing via `/commit` in messages doesn't work (Cursor intercepts `/` for UI)
- **What we didn't prove**: Whether Cursor's prompt template design could improve compliance
- **Actual Cursor design** (per [Cursor 1.6 docs](https://cursor.com/changelog/1-6)): `/command` → loads template from `.cursor/commands/command.md` → sends template content to assistant
- **Unexplored approach**: Create templates like `.cursor/commands/commit.md` containing "Use git-commit.sh to create conventional commit"
- **Meta-observation**: Made analytical leap from "approach A failed" to "feature not viable"; investigation's own reasoning error
- **Pattern**: Implementation failure ≠ feature non-viability; distinguish "how we tried" from "whether it can work"
- **Files affected**: slash-commands-decision.md, session summary, findings, tasks, README — all say "NOT VIABLE" incorrectly
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-16 immediately after documentation, user questioned the conclusion
- **Resolution**: Corrected all documentation; created prompt-templates-exploration.md for future consideration

### 11. Investigation documentation structure not defined

- **Issue**: Created 40 files across 5 directories without clear organizational principles; files in wrong places, duplicates exist, unclear when to create new files/folders
- **Evidence**:
  - Duplicate: `slash-commands-decision.md` in root AND test-execution/
  - Mixed purposes: test-execution/ contains protocols, results, sessions, decisions, discoveries (14 files, 5 different purposes)
  - Root clutter: 7 files in root when should have 4-5 baseline
  - No clear folders for: decisions/, guides/, protocols/, sessions/
- **User observation**: "Some details are being dumped into files that aren't supposed to be used for that purpose and files are being created in many places without a discernible pattern"
- **Impact**: Hard to navigate 40 files; unclear where new docs belong; pattern not reusable; duplicates waste effort
- **What's missing**:
  - Folder purpose definitions
  - Decision framework (when to create file/folder/sub-project)
  - Naming patterns
  - Structure guidance for complex investigations
- **Meta-observation**: While documenting gaps about ERD scope (Gap #5), tasks structure (Gap #3), and summary proliferation (Gap #6), created same structural issues in investigation itself
- **Pattern**: Complex investigations need explicit structure; absence of guidance leads to organic growth without organization
- **Files affected**: project-lifecycle.mdc needs investigation structure section
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-16 after creating session summary, platform constraints, prompt templates exploration - user noticed pattern
- **Resolution**: Created new project `investigation-docs-structure` to design structure standard and reorganize rules-enforcement-investigation

## Investigation Meta-Lessons

### Self-Referential Validation

Even while investigating rule enforcement, rules were violated:

- Context efficiency (2/5 bloated → 4/5 lean after consolidation)
- Project lifecycle (unclear completion states)
- Document standards (scope creep, duplication)

**This validates the investigation's findings**: Rules are easy to violate when:

- Excitement/momentum overrides process
- Focused on content, miss process signals
- Incremental drift goes unnoticed
- Missing regular checkpoints (gauge updates)

### Pattern Improvement Observed

Self-improvement pattern strengthened during investigation:

- **Gap 1**: User prompted multiple times before capture
- **Gap 2**: User prompted once before capture
- **Gaps 3-5**: Captured immediately when user pointed them out ✅

The investigation itself became data for the investigation.

### Key Insights

1. **Meta-tests save massive time**: 5 minutes vs 4 weeks to answer fundamental question
2. **Empirical evidence > speculation**: Live observation beats theoretical analysis
3. **Simple fixes often best**: One-line change (alwaysApply: false → true) solved primary issue
4. **Pattern-based improvement works**: Self-improve detected test plan patterns and proposed standardization

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Continue Monitoring)

- ✅ H1 validation complete (80% compliance vs 90% target)
- 🔄 Continue H2 monitoring (send gate visibility + effectiveness)
- 🔄 Continue H3 monitoring (query visibility + compliance impact)
- 📊 Check dashboard periodically (~every 5 commits)

### Phase 6D: Synthesis (Next Major Milestone)

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

1. **Analyze combined results**

   - H1: +6-11 points (validated)
   - H2: Gate visible, effectiveness TBD
   - H3: Query visible, impact TBD

2. **Create enforcement decision tree**

   - When to use alwaysApply (critical rules only)
   - When visible gates/queries help
   - When routing is sufficient

3. **Categorize 25 conditional rules**

   - Apply decision tree to each rule
   - Document recommended enforcement pattern
   - Estimate context impact

4. **Document scalable patterns**
   - Patterns that scale beyond 5 rules
   - Patterns for different rule types
   - CI integration recommendations

### Final Summary

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours

- Validated recommendations for all rule types
- Lessons learned about enforcement patterns
- Reusable patterns for other Cursor rules repos
- Meta-lessons from investigation itself

### Optional Follow-ups

- Deeper TDD pre-edit gate investigation (currently 83% vs 95% target)
- Prompt templates exploration (slash commands alternative)
- Apply alwaysApply to 4 other critical rules (tdd-first-js, tdd-first-sh, testing, refactoring)
