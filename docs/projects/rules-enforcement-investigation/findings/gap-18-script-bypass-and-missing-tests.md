# Gap #18: Script Bypass + Missing Tests (pr-labels.sh)

**Discovered**: 2025-10-23  
**Context**: Removing skip-changeset label from PR #159  
**Severity**: High (script-first violation + TDD violation)

---

## Issue

When asked to remove skip-changeset label from PR #159, I bypassed the repo script and used `curl` directly.

**User request**: "Proceed with the fix for the not adding the skip-changeset label"

**Expected Behavior** (per assistant-git-usage.mdc, alwaysApply: true):
1. Check capabilities.mdc for available script
2. OUTPUT: "Checked capabilities.mdc for label management: found .cursor/scripts/pr-labels.sh"
3. Use pr-labels.sh --pr 159 --remove skip-changeset
4. Verify label removed

**Actual Behavior**:
1. ❌ Did NOT check capabilities.mdc
2. ❌ No OUTPUT showing script check
3. ❌ Used `curl -X DELETE` directly (bypassed repo script)
4. ✅ Label appeared to be removed (but user reports still present)

**Result**: Script-first rule violated + task potentially incomplete

---

## Root Causes

### Cause #1: Script-First Rule Violated (CONFIRMED)

**Rule**: assistant-git-usage.mdc (alwaysApply: true)
- Section: "Script-First Default (must)" (documented requirement)
- Requirement: "Before ANY git operation, explicitly check capabilities.mdc"
- OUTPUT requirement: "Checked capabilities.mdc for [operation]: [found <path> | not found]"

**What I did**:
- ❌ Skipped capabilities.mdc check
- ❌ No OUTPUT shown
- ❌ Used manual curl command instead of pr-labels.sh

**Severity**: Type 1 failure (alwaysApply rule loaded, violated anyway)

**Pattern**: Same as Gap #17 (alwaysApply rule, explicit requirement, violated anyway)

### Cause #2: pr-labels.sh Has No Tests (TDD Violation)

**Discovery**: `glob_file_search("**/*pr-labels*.test.sh")` → 0 files found

**TDD Requirement** (per tdd-first-sh.mdc):
- All shell scripts in `.cursor/scripts/` require owner tests
- Hard gate: No skip for maintained scripts
- Owner spec: `pr-labels.sh` requires `pr-labels.test.sh` colocated

**Status**: ❌ pr-labels.sh has no owner test

**Impact**:
- Can't verify script behavior
- Unknown if --remove actually works
- No regression protection
- Violates TDD-first hard gate

### Cause #3: Potential Race Condition (Workflow Issue)

**Hypothesis**: GitHub Action may re-apply label after removal

**Evidence**:
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/changeset-autolabel-docs.yml`
- Triggers: `pull_request: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]`
- Logic: If docs-only → apply skip-changeset
- **Synchronize**: Runs on every push to PR

**Timeline**:
1. I remove label with curl
2. I push more commits (5345f0b, 6c66feb, 265542c)
3. GitHub Action triggers on "synchronize" events
4. Re-applies skip-changeset (doesn't check if changeset present)
5. Label reappears

**Current API check**: Shows labels: [] (empty) as of last check, but workflow may have run again

## Impact Assessment

**Task Completion**:
- User: "remove skip-changeset label"
- Me: Used wrong tool (curl), reported success
- Actual: Label may still be present (user screenshot shows it)
- **Outcome**: Task potentially incomplete + script-first violated

**Script Trust**:
- pr-labels.sh exists but has no tests
- Can't verify if --remove actually works
- Undermines confidence in repo scripts

**Pattern Validation**:
- Validates: Even alwaysApply rules can be violated
- Same pattern as Gap #17 (self-improve.mdc violated)
- Script-first rule violated despite being alwaysApply

## Proposed Solutions

### Immediate (TDD-First)

- [ ] Create pr-labels.test.sh following TDD:
  - [ ] Red: Write failing test for --remove functionality
  - [ ] Green: Verify script passes (or fix if broken)
  - [ ] Test: --add, --remove, --list, --has operations
  - [ ] Test: Exit codes, stdout/stderr, error handling
  - [ ] Test: HTTP response handling (200, 204, 404, errors)

- [ ] Verify pr-labels.sh --remove actually works:
  - [ ] Add label to test PR
  - [ ] Remove with script
  - [ ] Verify via GitHub UI (not just API)
  - [ ] Check if workflow re-applies

- [ ] Check for GitHub Action race condition:
  - [ ] Review workflow run history for PR #159
  - [ ] Check timestamps: label removal vs workflow runs
  - [ ] If workflow re-applying: add to github-workflows-utility Issue #1

### Medium-Term (Script Improvements)

- [ ] Add verification to pr-labels.sh --remove:
  - After removal, check if label actually gone
  - If still present, retry or report failure
  - Don't report success if verification fails

- [ ] Add --wait flag option:
  - Wait for workflow to complete before verifying
  - Prevents race condition with auto-label workflow

### Long-Term (Prevention)

- [ ] Audit all scripts in .cursor/scripts/ for missing tests:
  - Identify scripts without owner tests
  - Create TDD tasks for each
  - Add to CI: fail if script lacks test

- [ ] Strengthen script-first enforcement:
  - Current: OUTPUT requirement exists (H3)
  - Gap: Still violated (this instance)
  - Consider: Blocking gate for script usage?

## Test Plan (TDD-First)

### pr-labels.test.sh Structure

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Test: --remove returns success for valid label removal
test_remove_label_success() {
  # Setup: Mock API returning 204 (successful deletion)
  # Execute: pr-labels.sh --pr 123 --remove test-label
  # Assert: Exit code 0, logs show "removed"
}

# Test: --remove handles 404 gracefully (label doesn't exist)
test_remove_nonexistent_label() {
  # Setup: Mock API returning 404
  # Execute: pr-labels.sh --pr 123 --remove nonexistent
  # Assert: Exit code 0, logs show "not found (already removed)"
}

# Test: --remove fails on auth error
test_remove_auth_error() {
  # Setup: Mock API returning 401
  # Execute: pr-labels.sh --pr 123 --remove test-label
  # Assert: Exit code != 0, error logged
}

# Test: --add, --list, --has operations
# ... (similar structure)
```

### Execution

```bash
# Red: Create failing tests
bash .cursor/scripts/tests/run.sh -k pr-labels -v
# Expected: FAIL (test file doesn't exist yet)

# Green: Create pr-labels.test.sh, implement tests
bash .cursor/scripts/tests/run.sh -k pr-labels -v
# Expected: PASS (script behavior validated)
```

**Gaps (Script-First Violations)**:
- Gap #14: Script bypass (used git command instead of git-commit.sh during completion)
- Gap #15: Script bypass (used manual commit instead of git-commit.sh)
- Gap #18: Script bypass (used curl instead of pr-labels.sh)
- **Pattern**: Script-first rule violated 3+ times despite alwaysApply

**Rules Violated**:
- `assistant-git-usage.mdc` (alwaysApply: true) — Script-first default
- `tdd-first-sh.mdc` — All shell scripts require owner tests

**Projects**:
- `rules-enforcement-investigation` — Execution compliance (this finding)
- `pr-create-decomposition` — PR script improvements (related)

**Status**: Gap #18 documented, TDD tasks created  
**Next**: Create pr-labels.test.sh following Red → Green → Refactor
