# Gap #9: Changeset Policy Violated (3 Times Across 2 PRs)

**Discovered**: 2025-10-16 (Part 1 & 2), 2025-10-21 (Part 3)  
**Context**: PR #132 and PR #149 creation  
**Severity**: High (violated 3 times; pattern persists)

---

## Issue

Created PRs without changeset or forgot to remove `skip-changeset` label after adding changeset

## Evidence

### Part 1: PR #132 Without Changeset

- PR created with rule changes but no `.changeset/*.md` file
- PR description had unchecked "[ ] Changeset" item
- User caught it: "I noticed you submit the pr with the skip changeset flag"

### Part 2: PR #132 Label Not Removed

- Added changeset to PR
- Left `skip-changeset` label on PR
- Updated description but forgot label cleanup
- User caught it: "You submit the changset, but did not remove the skip changeset label"

### Part 3: PR #149 Label Not Removed (Gap #15)

- Created changeset file correctly
- Left `skip-changeset` label on PR (same as Part 2)
- **Also violated H1**: Used `curl` instead of `pr-labels.sh` script
- User caught both: "I see you are using a changeset and a skip-changeset label again. Also I notice that you did not use the script"

## Impact

- Violated changeset default policy
- Required THREE user corrections across 2 PRs
- Would have bypassed version tracking and CI checks
- Pattern persists despite documentation and gate improvements

## Rule Violated

`assistant-git-usage.mdc` → "When preparing a PR that includes code/rules/docs edits, include a Changeset by default"

## What Should Have Happened

1. Prompt to run `npx changeset` OR create `.changeset/<slug>.md` non-interactively OR ask for explicit skip consent
2. After adding changeset, remove any `skip-changeset` label and check the checkbox

## What Actually Happened

### PR #132
1. Created PR immediately without changeset or consent check
2. Added changeset but left `skip-changeset` label; updated description but forgot label cleanup

### PR #149
1. Created changeset correctly ✓
2. Left `skip-changeset` label ✗
3. Used curl instead of pr-labels.sh script ✗

## Meta-Observation

While investigating rule enforcement and documenting Gaps #1-8, violated another rule TWICE (incomplete fix). Then violated again while completing investigation (Part 3).

## Pattern

- Even high awareness of rules doesn't prevent violations
- Partial fixes require follow-up
- Automated/blocking gates needed
- **Part 3 validates**: Even with pre-send gate checklist item, violations occur (gate not blocking)

## Proposed Fix

From Gap #15 analysis:
1. Make pre-send gate **blocking** (FAIL stops message, forces revision)
2. Add skip-changeset label check to gate (if changeset added, verify label removed)
3. Add label removal reminder to git-commit workflow (when committing .changeset/ files)
4. Make script usage mandatory blocking (can't bypass with API calls)

## Files Affected

- Compliance gate checklist in `assistant-behavior.mdc`
- `pr-labels.sh` script usage enforcement

## Discovered

- Part 1: 2025-10-16 immediately after PR #132 creation
- Part 2: 2025-10-16 after changeset added
- Part 3: 2025-10-21 during PR #149 creation (Gap #15)

## Resolution

- ✅ PR #132: Changeset created, label removed
- ✅ PR #149: Label removed
- ⏸️ Blocking gate improvements: Tracked in Phase 6G task 30.0
