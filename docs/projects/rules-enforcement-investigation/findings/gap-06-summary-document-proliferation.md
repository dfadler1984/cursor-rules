# Gap #6: Summary Document Proliferation

**Discovered**: 2025-10-15  
**Context**: Summary consolidation  
**Severity**: Medium (document proliferation)

---

## Issue

No clear guidance on when multiple summary documents are needed vs single entry point

## Evidence

Created 3 summary documents (README, BREAKTHROUGH, EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY) with 70-80% content overlap (all telling same story)

## Impact

- Document proliferation (15 files)
- Redundancy
- Unclear which doc is authoritative
- Wasted consolidation effort

## Recommendation

Define standard entry point (README.md); avoid multiple summaries unless distinct audiences require different formats

## Pattern

- README.md = single entry point with navigation
- Specialized summaries only when justified by distinct audience needs

## Resolution

âœ… **Applied in Phase 1** (Task 19.0)

Updated rules:

- `project-lifecycle.mdc`: Added "README.md as Single Entry Point" section with structure template
- Added Single Entry Point Policy with justified vs unjustified criteria
- Added guidance: specialized summaries need clear justification ("Summary X for audience Y who needs Z")

Evidence: Created 3 summary docs with 70-80% overlap; cited as evidence with correct approach example

## Files Affected

- `.cursor/rules/project-lifecycle.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/create-erd.mdc`

## Violations of This Gap

**Gap #13**: Created FINAL-SUMMARY.md (violated Gap #6, 1 hour after documenting it)  
**Gap #14**: Created duplicate findings file (violated Gap #6 again)

Pattern: Documented the gap, violated it twice anyway (validates enforcement findings)
