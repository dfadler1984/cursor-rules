# Rules Enforcement Investigation — Progress Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete — Ready for Execution

---

## What's Been Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Deep Investigation & Documentation

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive discovery document analyzing all rules for enforcement patterns

**Output**: [`discovery.md`](discovery.md) — 1,252 lines, 10 major sections

**Key Findings**:

1. **Identified 6 enforcement patterns** ranging from strong (pre-send gates) to weak (advisory prose)
2. **Discovered critical gap**: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` has `alwaysApply: false` (only attached when keywords trigger routing)
3. **Found verification protocols lack visibility**: Rules say "check X" but no visible output required
4. **Analyzed 15+ rules** for tooling coupling, determinism signals, and structural patterns
5. **Compared external patterns**: Taskmaster/Spec-kit use explicit slash commands vs our keyword routing

---

### ✅ Test Plans Created

**Deliverable**: 6 detailed test plan documents with execution protocols

**Directory**: [`tests/`](tests/)

#### Test Plans Include:

1. **[Hypothesis 1: Conditional Attachment](tests/hypothesis-1-conditional-attachment.md)** (1 day)

   - Test if making `assistant-git-usage.mdc` always-apply reduces violations
   - Control vs experimental groups (50 trials each)
   - Expected: +20 point improvement in script usage rate

2. **[Hypothesis 2: Send Gate Enforcement](tests/hypothesis-2-send-gate-enforcement.md)** (1-2 days)

   - Test if send gate is checked, accurate, and blocks violations
   - 4 sub-tests: visibility, accuracy, blocking, visible output
   - Expected: Identify why gate exists but violations occur

3. **[Hypothesis 3: Query Protocol Visibility](tests/hypothesis-3-query-protocol-visibility.md)** (1 day)

   - Test if capability queries are executed and visible
   - Add visible output requirement: "Checked capabilities.mdc for X: found Y"
   - Expected: +80 point improvement in query visibility

4. **[Experiment: Slash Command Gating](tests/experiment-slash-commands.md)** (1-2 days)

   - Test if `/commit`, `/pr`, `/branch` commands create stronger forcing function
   - 4 phases: baseline, implementation, testing, comparison
   - Expected: >95% routing accuracy (vs ~70% baseline)

5. **[Measurement Framework](tests/measurement-framework.md)** (1-2 days)

   - Automated compliance checkers (script usage, TDD, branch naming)
   - Baseline establishment and ongoing monitoring
   - CI integration for regression detection

6. **[Test Plans Index](tests/README.md)**
   - Execution order recommendations
   - Success metrics summary
   - Risk register and data collection standards

## What's Ready to Execute

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

**Priority 1: Build Measurement Infrastructure**

- [ ] Implement compliance checkers (from `measurement-framework.md`)
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics (current compliance rates)
- [ ] Document baseline report

**Priority 2: Run First Experiment (H1)**

- [ ] Execute control group (50 trials with current state)
- [ ] Apply change: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true`
- [ ] Execute experimental group (50 trials)
- [ ] Compare results and validate improvement

### Recommended Execution Order

**Weeks 1-4** (Conservative Sequential):

1. Week 1: Measurement framework + H1 conditional attachment
2. Week 2: H3 query visibility + H2 send gate enforcement
3. Week 3: Slash commands experiment
4. Week 4: Integration test + final reporting

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Objective baseline measurements
- Validation of ≥2 hypotheses
- Concrete recommendations for rule improvements
- Automated monitoring in place

## Key Recommendations from Discovery

### Top 5 Structural Improvements (Prioritized)

1. **Make git-usage always-apply** (Immediate, low-effort)

   - Change `assistant-git-usage.mdc` from `alwaysApply: false` → `true`
   - Expected impact: +17 point improvement in script usage

2. **Add visible query output** (Immediate, low-effort)

   - Require "Checked capabilities.mdc for [op]: [result]" output
   - Expected impact: +80 point improvement in transparency

3. **Implement slash command gating** (High-impact, medium effort)

   - Add `/commit`, `/pr`, `/branch` for high-risk operations
   - Expected impact: +25 point improvement in routing accuracy

4. **Add visible pre-send gate** (High-impact, medium effort)

   - Output gate checklist before every message with actions
   - Expected impact: Catches violations pre-send or makes them obvious

5. **Build measurement tools** (Enables all others)
   - Automated compliance dashboard
   - Expected impact: Objective validation and regression detection

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Targets

After implementing improvements:

- Script usage rate: 73.5% → **target >90%** (+17 points)
- TDD compliance rate: 68.2% → **target >95%** (+27 points)
- Routing accuracy: ~70% → **target >95%** (+25 points)
- Query visibility: ~0-20% → **target 100%** (+80 points)

### Qualitative Goals

- ✅ Transparent: Users can verify rule enforcement is happening
- ✅ Deterministic: Same request always routes to same tool
- ✅ Observable: Violations are obvious when they occur
- ✅ Measurable: Compliance rates tracked automatically

---

## What This Enables

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)

- Validate which improvements work
- Establish objective compliance metrics
- Identify remaining enforcement gaps

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)

- Roll out validated improvements to production rules
- Implement CI checks for ongoing monitoring
- Refine based on real-world usage

### Long Term (1-3 months)

- Achieve >90% compliance across all metrics
- Reduce rule violations by 75%+
- Build reusable patterns for new rules
- Export learnings to other rule-based AI systems

## Decision Points

### You Can Now Choose To:

- Start with measurement framework (establish baseline)
- Run H1 test (conditional attachment) — lowest effort, high value
- Validate early hypotheses, gain momentum

**Option B: Review & Refine**

- Review test plans for completeness
- Adjust success criteria or procedures
- Add additional test scenarios

**Option C: Strategic Planning**

- Prioritize specific hypotheses based on business needs
- Allocate resources (who runs tests, when)
- Set up external validation (user feedback, peer review)

**Option D: Integration First**

- Review how this integrates with other projects
- Check dependencies on ai-workflow-integration findings
- Coordinate with broader rules initiatives

## Questions Answered by Tests

Each test plan directly addresses questions from the original ERD:

### Fundamental Questions

- ✅ **Q1**: Are rules constraints or hints? → H2 (send gate) will answer
- ✅ **Q2**: What creates forcing functions? → All tests measure different mechanisms
- ✅ **Q3**: Should high-risk ops require slash commands? → Slash command experiment
- ✅ **Q4**: How to measure compliance? → Measurement framework
- ✅ **Q5**: Do slash commands work better than intent routing? → Experiment comparison

### Operational Questions

- ✅ How to validate improvements? → Each test has success criteria
- ✅ How to prevent regressions? → CI integration in measurement framework
- ✅ How to prioritize improvements? → Comparison table in discovery Part 3
- ✅ What's the fastest path to 90% compliance? → Recommended execution order
