2. **H2 Test Plan Enhancement**:

   - Add section on gate interaction scenarios
   - Define precedence when multiple gates fire

3. **Slash Commands Enhancement**:
   - Add explicit error handling scenarios
   - Define help system behavior specification

### Nice-to-Have (Future Improvements)

1. **Cross-test integration matrix**: Document how H1/H2/H3/Slash Commands interact
