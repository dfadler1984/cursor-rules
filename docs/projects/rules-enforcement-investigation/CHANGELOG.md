# Changelog — Rules Enforcement & Effectiveness Investigation

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
adapted for project lifecycle tracking.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Monitoring

- H2/H3 data accumulating passively (transparency value assessment)
- Pattern-aware prevention monitoring (Gap #13 mitigation)

---

## [Phase 6G: Rule Improvements] - 2025-10-24

### Summary

Applied all 9 rule improvement tasks from synthesis phase. Updated 4 rules, improved 2 scripts, implemented blocking gates and mandatory script usage enforcement.

### Added

- Pre-file-creation OUTPUT requirement in `self-improve.mdc`
- Pattern-aware prevention checklist (Gap #13 mitigation)
- ACTIVE-MONITORING.md reference in investigation workflow
- Explicit OUTPUT requirement for categorization in `investigation-structure.mdc`
- Findings review checkpoint in `project-lifecycle.mdc`
- Blocking gates in `assistant-behavior.mdc` (DO NOT SEND on FAIL)
- Mandatory script usage enforcement (script-first violations → FAIL)
- Label consistency checks for PR operations

### Changed

- `check-tdd-compliance.sh`: Doc-only change filtering improved
- `check-tdd-compliance.test.sh`: Robust test cases for both output formats
- Task naming guidance in `project-lifecycle.mdc`

### Decisions

- **Blocking enforcement over advisory**: Gates must halt message send on violations (Gap #15)
- **OUTPUT requirements create accountability**: Explicit visibility prevents structure violations (Gap #12)
- **Script-first mandatory**: Script existence check + mandatory usage prevents API bypass (Gap #18)

---

## [Phase 6F: Synthesis Complete] - 2025-10-22

### Summary

Completed synthesis with decision tree, 25-rule categorization, and scalable enforcement patterns documented.

### Added

- Decision tree for rule enforcement patterns
- 25-rule categorization by attachment strategy
- Scalable patterns documentation (`analysis/synthesis.md`)
- Meta-findings compilation (Gaps #1-18)

### Decisions

- **alwaysApply for foundational rules**: Script-first, consent, TDD gates need global scope
- **Conditional for specialized rules**: Feature-specific rules attach on intent signals
- **Defer H2/H3 to passive monitoring**: H1 at 100% compliance already exceeds targets

---

## [Phase 6A-D: H1 Validation] - 2025-10-15 to 2025-10-21

### Summary

Validated Hypothesis 1 (conditional attachment root cause). Achieved 100% script-first compliance (+26 points from baseline), confirming alwaysApply fix effectiveness.

### Added

- Measurement framework (4 compliance checkers + dashboard)
- Baseline metrics (68% overall: 71% script, 72% TDD, 62% branch)
- 30-commit validation dataset
- Gap findings #1-18 documenting meta-patterns

### Changed

- `assistant-git-usage.mdc`: Set `alwaysApply: true` (H1 fix)
- Script-first compliance: 74% → 100% (+26 points)
- TDD compliance: 72% → 100% (+28 points)
- Overall compliance: 68% → 97% (+29 points)

### Decisions

- **H1 confirmed as root cause**: Conditional attachment prevented script-first enforcement
- **alwaysApply fix validated**: 100% compliance proves effectiveness
- **Meta-test approach validated**: Self-improvement patterns (Gap #2) confirmed through lived experience

### Fixed

- Gap #6: Document proliferation (summary files)
- Gap #9: Changeset policy violations
- Gap #12: Investigation structure blind spots
- Gap #13: Document proliferation repetition
- Gap #14: Findings review issues
- Gap #15: Script bypass on errors and changeset label violations
- Gap #20: Manual CHANGELOG.md edit (Changesets violation)
- Gap #21: Empty final summaries

---

## [Phase 5: Test Plan Development] - 2025-10-13 to 2025-10-14

### Summary

Created comprehensive test plans for 7 hypotheses with measurement framework, success criteria, and risk mitigation.

### Added

- Test plans: H0 (meta-test), H1 (conditional), H2 (send gate), H3 (query visibility)
- Test plans: Slash commands (Phase 3)
- Measurement framework design
- Success criteria and timelines for each hypothesis

### Decisions

- **Meta-test first**: Validate self-improvement patterns before testing enforcement
- **Sequential execution**: Prioritize H0 → H1 → H2/H3 → scalability experiments
- **20-30 commit validation**: Real usage data required to confirm fix effectiveness

---

## [Phase 4: Always-Apply Review] - 2025-10-12

### Summary

Systematically reviewed all 21 alwaysApply rules and 30+ conditional rules, categorizing by purpose and attachment strategy.

### Added

- 21-rule alwaysApply analysis
- Conditional rules inventory (30+ rules)
- Categorization by purpose (foundational, quality gates, workflow)

### Decisions

- **Keep most alwaysApply rules**: 18/21 are foundational or quality gates
- **Candidate for conditional**: 3 rules could be event-driven (changelog, efficiency, five-whys)
- **Git usage should be alwaysApply**: Prevents script-first violations (hypothesis)

---

## [Phase 3: Enforcement Patterns Discovery] - 2025-10-11

### Summary

Discovered enforcement mechanisms: alwaysApply, globs, intent routing, pre-send gate.

### Added

- Enforcement patterns documentation
- Initial hypothesis: conditional attachment as root cause
- Slack findings: slash commands vs prompt templates confusion

### Decisions

- **Focus on attachment mechanisms**: Rule content quality already high
- **Test conditional vs alwaysApply**: Primary investigation angle

---

## [Phase 1-2: Discovery & Baseline] - 2025-10-08 to 2025-10-10

### Summary

Initial discovery and baseline establishment. Confirmed violation patterns and designed measurement approach.

### Added

- ERD and investigation structure
- Initial violation examples (script-first, consent-first)
- Baseline compliance measurement approach

### Decisions

- **Investigation over immediate fixes**: Understand root causes before applying band-aids
- **Quantitative measurement required**: Build checkers for objective assessment
- **Self-improvement meta-pattern**: Investigation itself generates rule gaps (H0)

---

## Notes

**Total Duration**: ~20 days (2025-10-08 to 2025-10-27)  
**Outcome**: 100% H1 compliance validated, decision tree created, 18 meta-findings documented  
**Status**: COMPLETE (Active) — Monitoring carryovers for H2/H3 passive data
