## Key Insights from This Session

### 1. Scalability Is Non-Negotiable

**Finding**: Cannot make all 25 conditional rules always-apply

- Context would grow from 34k → 67k tokens (+97%)
- Less room for code, slower responses, higher cost
- Need multiple enforcement patterns, not one-size-fits-all

**6 Scalable Patterns Identified**:

1. Script-based validation (O(0) cost)
2. Progressive attachment (O(1+n) cost)
3. Intent routing (O(log n) if accurate)
4. Linter integration (O(0) cost)
5. Slash commands (O(1) cost)
6. Tool constraints (O(0) cost)

### 2. Document Boundaries Matter

**Problem**: Content bloat when boundaries are unclear

- ERD: 441 lines (73-line findings section)
- 3 overlapping summaries (70-80% duplicate)

**Solution**: Strict separation

- ERD = requirements (narrative, stable)
- README.md = navigation (single entry point)

### 3. Hard Gates Prevent Premature Closure

**Problem**: Project marked complete with major work incomplete

- 5 phases unfinished
- Applied fix not validated
- Core research questions deferred

**Solution**: Pre-Closure Checklist (8 mandatory items)

- All acceptance criteria validated
- All deliverables complete
- Validation period complete
- User approval obtained
- **Cannot skip any gate**

### 4. Test Plans Are High Quality

**Validation Results**:

- Completeness: 9/10
- Measurability: 10/10
- Protocols: 9/10
- Coverage: 8/10

**All tests ready to execute** (H2, H3, Slash Commands)

### 5. Meta-Findings Are Valuable

**Irony**: Investigation of rule enforcement created rule gaps

- Studied premature closure → experienced premature closure
- Studied gate violations → violated completion gate
- **Lesson**: Investigations validate their own patterns

**New Protocol**: During investigations, treat observed gaps as first-class data (real-time flagging, not reactive)

---

## What Remains

### Phase 6A: H1 Validation (In Progress)

**Status**: AWAITING DATA (0/20-30 commits)

- Fix applied: `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true`
- Protocol documented: `h1-validation-protocol.md`
- Checkpoints: After 10, 20, 30 commits
- **Blocking**: Need real-world usage data

**Timeline**: 4-15 days (depends on natural commit rate)

### Phase 6B: H2 (Send Gate) — Ready to Execute

**Test**: Does send gate execute? Is it accurate? Does it block?

- Test A: Visibility (20 trials) — 2-3 hours
- Test B: Accuracy (10 violations) — 1-2 hours
- Test C: Blocking behavior — 1 hour
- Test D: Visible gate experiment — 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 8-12 hours

**Dependencies**: None (can execute anytime)

### Phase 6C: H3 + Slash Commands — Ready to Execute

**H3 Test**: Does query execute? Would visibility help?

- Test A: Baseline visibility — 2-3 hours
- Test C: Visible output — 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 6-8 hours

**Slash Commands Experiment**:

- Phase 1: Baseline — 3-4 hours
- Phase 2: Implementation — 2 hours
- Phase 3: Testing — 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 8-10 hours

**Dependencies**: Can execute anytime; ideally after H1 validates for clean attribution

### Phase 6D: Synthesis — Pending

**Work**: Create decision tree for enforcement patterns

- When to use alwaysApply (20 critical rules)
- When to use alternative patterns (25 conditional rules)
- Scalable approach for each rule type

**Dependencies**: H1 validation + ideally H2/H3 results

**Effort**: 2-4 hours

## Completion Calculation (Updated)

### Weighted Approach

**Critical Path (60%)**:

- [x] Measurement framework (12%)
- [x] Baseline metrics (8%)
- [x] Discovery work (10%)
- [x] Review work (5%)
- [ ] H1 validation (10%)
- [ ] H2 investigation (8%)
- [ ] H3 investigation (5%)
- [ ] Synthesis (2%)
- **Subtotal**: 35% of 60% = **21%**

**Supporting (30%)**:

- [x] Test plans (10%)
- [x] Pre-test discovery (8%)
- [x] Rule improvements (10%)
- [ ] Documentation updates (2%)
- **Subtotal**: 28% of 30% = **8.4%**

**Optional (10%)**:

- [ ] Slash commands (5%)
- [ ] CI integration (3%)
- [ ] Additional analysis (2%)
- **Subtotal**: 0% of 10% = **0%**

**Total Weighted**: 21% + 8.4% + 0% = **29.4%** ≈ **~30-40%**

_(Note: Earlier estimate of 40% may be slightly optimistic; conservative estimate is 30%)_

## What Happens Next (Decision Points)

### Path A: Natural Validation (Recommended)

**Now**:

- Continue normal repository work
- Git operations accumulate naturally
- Check dashboard periodically

**After ~10 Commits** (Check Point 1):

- Run: `bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 10`
- See trend: improving/stable/declining
- Decision: Continue or pivot

**After 20-30 Commits** (Full Validation):

- Run: `bash .cursor/scripts/compliance-dashboard.sh --limit 30`
- Three outcomes:
  - **Success (>90%)**: Proceed to synthesis (~4 hours)
  - **Partial (80-90%)**: Execute H3 (~6-8 hours)
  - **Failure (<80%)**: Execute H2 + H3 (~14-20 hours)

**Timeline**: 4-15 days + 4-20 hours depending on results

### Path B: Parallel Hypothesis Testing (Aggressive)

**Now**:

- Execute H2 (send gate) immediately (~8-12 hours)
- Execute H3 (query visibility) immediately (~6-8 hours)
- Continue normal work (accumulates H1 data)

**After H2/H3 Complete**:

- Have comprehensive enforcement understanding
- Still wait for H1 validation data
- Synthesis with full picture

**Timeline**: 1 week + synthesis (~4 hours)

**Trade-off**: More data but confounded attribution (can't isolate H1 vs H2/H3 effects)

### Path C: Pause and Monitor (Conservative)

**Now**:

- Stop investigation work entirely
- Resume when sufficient commits accumulated

**After 20-30 Commits**:

- Return to investigation
- Validate and proceed based on results

**Timeline**: 4-15 days (passive) + future work

**Trade-off**: Cleanest data but longest calendar time

---

## Recommendations

### For Maximum Impact (Recommended)

**Hybrid Approach**: Natural validation + opportunistic progress

1. **This session**: ✅ DONE

   - All discovery complete
   - All review complete
   - All rule improvements complete
   - Validation protocol established

2. **Next 4-15 days** (Passive monitoring):

   - Work normally on repository
   - Commits accumulate as H1 validation data
   - Each git operation tests the fix

3. **Periodic checks**:

   - After ~10 commits: Quick trend check
   - After ~20-30 commits: Full validation

4. **Based on H1 results**:
   - Success → Synthesis (4 hours)
   - Partial → Execute H3 (6-8 hours)
   - Failure → Execute H2 + H3 (14-20 hours)

**Total Investigation Time**: Already invested ~10 hours; remaining 4-24 hours depending on H1 results

### For Fastest Comprehensive Answers

**Parallel Testing**: Execute H2 + H3 now

- Get all answers within 1 week
- Trade-off: Less clean attribution
- Still need H1 validation data to accumulate
