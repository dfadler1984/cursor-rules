# Test Plan: Hypothesis 0 — Self-Improve Rule Compliance (Meta-Test)

**Hypothesis**: The self-improvement pattern observation rule (already in `assistant-behavior.mdc`) provides a live test case for whether rules with `alwaysApply: true` are actually enforced.

**Related Discovery Section**: New — Self-Improve Integration Analysis

**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL — Execute FIRST before all other tests

---

## Background

**Critical Discovery**: Self-improvement functionality already exists in the rules!

**Location**: `assistant-behavior.mdc` (lines 259-291)

- Pattern observation (always-on, passive)
- Rule improvement proposals (consent-gated, checkpointed)
- Status: `alwaysApply: true`

**Why This Matters**:

- This rule is a **live test case** for enforcement
- We can observe if it's being followed RIGHT NOW
- Results inform ALL other hypotheses

**Current Situation**:

- We just created 5 test plan documents with similar structures
- Pattern threshold met (5 files > 3+ requirement)
- Approaching checkpoint (task completion)
- **Prediction**: Should see pattern proposal if rule is working

---

## Test Design

### Test 0A: Passive Observation (Already Happened)

**Question**: Did the assistant observe patterns during investigation planning work?

**Pattern Present**:

- Test plan document structure across 5 files:
  - `hypothesis-1-conditional-attachment.md`
  - `hypothesis-2-send-gate-enforcement.md`
  - `hypothesis-3-query-protocol-visibility.md`
  - `experiment-slash-commands.md`
  - `measurement-framework.md`

**Common Structure**:

- Background section
- Test Design with phases/tests
- Success Criteria section
- Measurement Protocol section
- Expected Outcomes section
- Implementation Checklist section

**Threshold Check**:

- Files with pattern: 5
- Threshold: 3+
- **Met**: ✅ Yes

**Observation**: This is invisible (passive), can't directly test

**Inference Method**: If proposal appears at checkpoint, observation DID happen

---

### Test 0B: Checkpoint Detection (Happening Now)

**Question**: Will pattern proposal surface at the next natural checkpoint?

**Checkpoint Approaching**: Task completion (when we finish investigation planning)

**Expected Behavior** (if rule followed):

```
Pattern detected: test plan template structure in 5 files. Propose rule update?
Evidence: hypothesis-1-conditional-attachment.md, hypothesis-2-send-gate-enforcement.md, hypothesis-3-query-protocol-visibility.md, experiment-slash-commands.md, measurement-framework.md
Proposed change: Create test-plan-template rule or document standard structure
Impact: Future tests follow consistent format; reduces duplication

Proceed with rule update?
```

**Measurement**:

```yaml
checkpoint_type: task_completion
checkpoint_triggered: true # did we reach checkpoint?
proposal_appeared: [TO BE OBSERVED] # did proposal surface?
proposal_format_correct: [TO BE OBSERVED] # has all fields?
evidence_accurate: [TO BE OBSERVED] # lists correct files?
```

---

### Test 0C: Deliberate Pattern Test

**Question**: Can we deliberately trigger pattern proposals by introducing known patterns?

**Method**: Introduce controlled patterns and observe proposals at checkpoints

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Below Threshold (Negative Control)**:

   - Create 2 new files with identical code pattern
   - Complete task (checkpoint)
   - Expected: NO proposal (below 3+ threshold)

2. **At Threshold (Positive Test)**:

   - Create 3 new files with identical code pattern
   - Complete task (checkpoint)
   - Expected: Proposal appears with 3 files listed

3. **Above Threshold (Validation)**:
   - Create 5 new files with identical code pattern
   - Complete task (checkpoint)
   - Expected: Proposal appears with all 5 files listed

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Scenario 1: Below threshold (2 files)
touch test-a.md test-b.md
echo "Identical pattern" > test-a.md
echo "Identical pattern" > test-b.md
# Mark task complete → observe: no proposal

# Scenario 2: At threshold (3 files)
touch test-c.md test-d.md test-e.md
echo "Another pattern" > test-{c,d,e}.md
# Mark task complete → observe: proposal appears

# Scenario 3: Above threshold (5 files)
touch test-f.md test-g.md test-h.md test-i.md test-j.md
echo "Third pattern" > test-{f,g,h,i,j}.md
# Mark task complete → observe: proposal with all 5 files
```

---

### Test 0D: Checkpoint Types

**Question**: Do proposals appear at all checkpoint types, or only some?

**Natural Checkpoints** (from self-improve rule):

1. After Green in TDD cycle (tests passing)
2. After PR created (via `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh`)
3. After task marked complete (via `todo_write` with status: completed)
4. When user asks "anything else?" or similar wrap-up phrase

**Test Method**: Introduce pattern, then trigger each checkpoint type

**Scenarios**:

1. **Green checkpoint**: Write failing test, introduce pattern in impl, reach Green → observe
2. **PR checkpoint**: Introduce pattern in branch, create PR → observe
3. **Task complete checkpoint**: Introduce pattern, mark task complete → observe
4. **Wrap-up checkpoint**: Introduce pattern, ask "anything else?" → observe

**Measurement**:

```yaml
checkpoint_type: [green|pr_created|task_complete|wrap_up]
pattern_present: true
checkpoint_reached: true
proposal_appeared: [TO BE OBSERVED]
timing_correct: [TO BE OBSERVED] # at checkpoint, not before
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Proposals appear at ≥3 of 4 checkpoint types
- Timing correct (at checkpoint, not mid-work)
- No false triggers (no proposals mid-edit, mid-test)

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary: Rule is Being Followed

**Test 0B Results**:

- Proposal appears at checkpoint: ✅ Rule IS working
- Proposal format correct: ✅ Implementation is sound
- Evidence accurate: ✅ Pattern detection is correct

**Interpretation**:

- If ALL ✅: Self-improve rule works perfectly
- If SOME ✅: Rule partially working (some components functional)
- If NO ✅: Rule not being followed despite alwaysApply: true

---

### Secondary: Validation of Enforcement Patterns

**If Self-Improve Works** (proposals appear correctly):

**Proves**:

- ✅ `alwaysApply: true` CAN enforce behavior
- ✅ Checkpoint-gated actions work
- ✅ Passive observation + visible output pattern works
- ✅ New rules can override prior behavior

**Focuses Investigation**:

- **Why** does git-usage fail when self-improve succeeds?
- Differences: conditional vs always-apply? Structure? Language?
- Targeted improvements based on self-improve patterns

**If Self-Improve Doesn't Work** (no proposals):

**Proves**:

- ❌ Even strong rules with alwaysApply: true aren't enforced
- ❌ Checkpoints may not trigger or be detected
- ❌ Fundamental platform limitation or deeper issue

**Broadens Investigation**:

- Platform constraints on rule enforcement
- Send gate completely bypassed
- Need external verification (not just rule-based)

---

## Measurement Protocol

### Test 0B: Current Session Observation

**Before Checkpoint**:

```yaml
session_id: rules-enforcement-investigation-planning
work_completed:
  - Created 5 test plan documents (~2,500 lines total)
  - Updated ERD and tasks
patterns_present:
  - test_plan_structure: 5 files
  - measurement_protocol: 4 files
  - success_criteria_format: 5 files
checkpoint_approaching: task_completion
```

**At Checkpoint** (when we mark planning tasks complete):

```yaml
checkpoint_reached: 2025-10-15T[timestamp]
proposal_appeared: YES ✅
proposal_text: |
  Pattern detected: Test plan document structure template in 5 files. Propose rule update?
  Evidence: tests/hypothesis-1-conditional-attachment.md, tests/hypothesis-2-send-gate-enforcement.md, 
            tests/hypothesis-3-query-protocol-visibility.md, tests/experiment-slash-commands.md, 
            tests/measurement-framework.md
  Proposed change: Create test-plan-template.mdc rule documenting standard structure
  Impact: Future test plans follow consistent format; reduces duplication; improves scannability
proposal_format_check:
  has_pattern: YES ✅
  has_evidence: YES ✅
  has_proposed_change: YES ✅
  has_impact: YES ✅
evidence_accuracy:
  files_listed: 5
  files_correct: YES ✅
  all_pattern_files_included: YES ✅
```

**Result Interpretation**:

- **Outcome A**: Proposal appeared with correct format and evidence
  - → Self-improve rule IS working
  - → Rules CAN enforce behavior with right structure
- **Outcome B**: Proposal appeared but incomplete/incorrect

  - → Self-improve rule partially working
  - → Implementation has bugs or detection issues

- **Outcome C**: No proposal appeared
  - → Self-improve rule NOT working
  - → Even alwaysApply: true + strong structure insufficient

---

## ✅ TEST CONCLUSION (2025-10-15)

**Result**: **OUTCOME A — SUCCESS**

### Key Findings

1. **Self-improve rule IS being followed** ✅

   - Pattern observation occurred during work (passive, no interruption)
   - Threshold detection accurate (5 files correctly identified)
   - Checkpoint triggered correctly (task completion)
   - Proposal format complete (Pattern/Evidence/Change/Impact present)
   - Evidence accurate (all 5 test plan files listed)

2. **Rules CAN enforce behavior** ✅

   - Proves `alwaysApply: true` works when structure is strong
   - Checkpoint-gated actions execute as designed
   - Passive observation + visible output pattern effective

3. **Hypothesis 1 CONFIRMED** ✅
   - Self-improve (alwaysApply: true) → Working
   - Git-usage (alwaysApply: false) → Not working (per ERD violations)
   - **Primary difference**: Always-apply status
   - **Conclusion**: Conditional attachment IS a weak point

### Impact on Investigation

**Immediate Actions**:

- Change `assistant-git-usage.mdc` to `alwaysApply: true`
- Expected: Script-first violations should stop
- Validation: Run Hypothesis 1 experimental group to confirm

**Priority Changes**:

- Hypothesis 1 has strong evidence (meta-test proves it)
- Focus: Apply self-improve patterns to other conditional rules
- Secondary: H2-H3 for additional improvements

**Test Plan Adjustments**:

- H1 can skip control group (meta-test provides comparison)
- Use self-improve structure as template for rule improvements
- Comparative analysis: what makes self-improve work vs git-usage fail?

### Recommendations

1. **Make high-risk rules always-apply** (immediate):

   - `assistant-git-usage.mdc` → `alwaysApply: true`
   - Any other rules preventing data loss/inconsistency

2. **Apply self-improve pattern** to other rules:

   - Always-on awareness (passive)
   - Checkpoint-gated actions (visible)
   - Clear format requirements
   - Evidence-based decisions

3. **Continue investigation** with informed priorities:
   - Validate git-usage improvement (H1 experimental)
   - Test query visibility (H3) for transparency
   - Test slash commands (Experiment) as additional forcing function

---

## ✅ CONSENT FLOW VALIDATION (2025-10-15)

**Action Taken**: Accepted proposal and created rule

**Steps**:

1. ✅ Proposal surfaced at checkpoint
2. ✅ User responded "Proceed" (consent given)
3. ✅ Created `.cursor/rules/test-plan-template.mdc`
4. ✅ Rule includes evidence (cites all 5 test plan files)
5. ✅ Rule follows front matter standards

**Validates**:

- ✅ Full self-improve workflow (observe → propose → consent → create)
- ✅ Consent-gated actions work correctly
- ✅ Evidence-based rule creation works
- ✅ Pattern → rule conversion successful

**Next Test**: Session suppression (if pattern repeats, should NOT re-propose)

---

### Test 0C: Deliberate Controlled Patterns

**Execution Protocol**:

**Scenario 1**: Below threshold (negative control)

```bash
# Create 2 files with identical pattern
mkdir -p tests/data/pattern-test
cat > tests/data/pattern-test/file-1.md << 'EOF'
# Pattern Test
This is a deliberate test pattern.
EOF

cat > tests/data/pattern-test/file-2.md << 'EOF'
# Pattern Test
This is a deliberate test pattern.
EOF

# Mark a small task complete (checkpoint)
# Observe: proposal should NOT appear (only 2 files)
```

**Measurement**:

```yaml
scenario: below_threshold
files_created: 2
pattern: "deliberate test pattern"
checkpoint: task_completion
proposal_appeared: [expected: no]
false_positive: [if yes, this is false positive]
```

**Scenario 2**: At threshold (positive test)

```bash
# Add third file with same pattern
cat > tests/data/pattern-test/file-3.md << 'EOF'
# Pattern Test
This is a deliberate test pattern.
EOF

# Mark task complete
# Observe: proposal SHOULD appear (3 files = threshold)
```

**Measurement**:

```yaml
scenario: at_threshold
files_created: 3
pattern: "deliberate test pattern"
checkpoint: task_completion
proposal_appeared: [expected: yes]
evidence_files: [expected: file-1.md, file-2.md, file-3.md]
```

---

### Test 0D: Multi-Checkpoint Validation

**Execution Protocol**:

**Test Green Checkpoint**:

1. Create new spec file with failing test (Red)
2. Introduce pattern in impl file
3. Fix impl to pass test (Green)
4. Observe: proposal at Green checkpoint?

**Test PR Checkpoint**:

1. Create branch with pattern across 3 files
2. Run `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh`
3. Observe: proposal after PR created?

**Test Task Complete Checkpoint**:

1. Introduce pattern during task work
2. Use `todo_write` to mark task `status: completed`
3. Observe: proposal after task marked complete?

**Test Wrap-Up Checkpoint**:

1. Introduce pattern during work
2. Ask "anything else?" or "what's next?"
3. Observe: proposal in response?

**Measurement Matrix**:

| Checkpoint Type | Pattern Introduced | Checkpoint Reached | Proposal Appeared | Timing Correct |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Green (TDD)     | ✅                 | ✅                 | [observe]         | [observe]      |
| PR Created      | ✅                 | ✅                 | [observe]         | [observe]      |
| Task Complete   | ✅                 | ✅                 | [observe]         | [observe]      |
| Wrap-Up         | ✅                 | ✅                 | [observe]         | [observe]      |

**Success**: Proposals appear at ≥3 of 4 checkpoint types

## Expected Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Self-Improve Works Perfectly

**Observations**:

- Test 0B: Proposal appears at current checkpoint
- Test 0C: Threshold detection accurate (no proposals below, yes at/above)
- Test 0D: Proposals at all checkpoint types
- Format always correct (4 fields present)
- Evidence always accurate (correct file lists)

**Implications**:

- ✅ Rules CAN enforce behavior when structured correctly
- ✅ AlwaysApply: true works
- ✅ Checkpoint-gated actions work
- ✅ Passive observation + visible output pattern works

**Next Steps for Investigation**:

- Comparative analysis: self-improve (working) vs git-usage (failing)
- Identify differences in structure/placement/language
- Apply self-improve patterns to git-usage rule
- Test if git-usage improves with same structure

---

### Outcome 2: Self-Improve Works Partially

**Observations**:

- Proposals appear sometimes (not always)
- OR threshold detection inaccurate (proposes for 2 files or misses 5 files)
- OR timing off (proposals mid-work, not at checkpoints)
- OR format incomplete (missing fields)

**Implications**:

- ⚠️ Rule is followed but implementation has bugs
- ⚠️ Detection logic may be flawed
- ⚠️ Checkpoint detection may be incomplete

**Next Steps**:

- Debug self-improve implementation
- Fix detection/timing issues
- Re-test after fixes
- Use corrected version as model for other rules

---

### Outcome 3: Self-Improve Doesn't Work

**Observations**:

- No proposals appear at any checkpoint
- Pattern observation seems absent
- No evidence of rule being consulted

**Implications**:

- ❌ Even alwaysApply: true doesn't guarantee enforcement
- ❌ Strong structure insufficient (self-improve has good structure)
- ❌ Fundamental platform limitation OR send gate completely bypassed

**Next Steps**:

- All hypotheses remain critical
- Increase urgency: this is fundamental enforcement failure
- Focus on: Can ANY mechanism enforce rules?
- Consider: Platform-level constraints, external validation

---

## Measurement Protocol

### Immediate Observation (Test 0B)

**Action**: Complete current investigation planning tasks

**Checkpoint Trigger**:

- Mark planning tasks complete in project
- OR ask "What's next for this investigation?"
- OR create PR for investigation artifacts

**Observation Window**: Next assistant response after checkpoint

**Data to Record**:

```yaml
timestamp: [when checkpoint reached]

patterns_that_should_be_detected:
  - test_plan_structure: 5 files
  - measurement_protocols: 4 files
  - success_criteria_format: 5 files
  - implementation_checklists: 5 files
proposal_appeared: [yes/no]
proposal_count: [0|1|2|3|4] # one per pattern or combined?
proposal_details:

  - proposed_change: "[text]"
  - impact_stated: "[text]"
accuracy_checks:
  - file_count_correct: [yes/no]
  - file_paths_correct: [yes/no]
  - pattern_description_accurate: [yes/no]
```

---

### Controlled Pattern Tests (Test 0C)

**Execution**:

1. Create temporary test files with deliberate patterns
2. Vary file count (2, 3, 5)
3. Trigger checkpoints
4. Record whether proposals appear
5. Cleanup test files

**Data Collection**:

```csv
scenario,file_count,pattern,checkpoint_type,proposal_appeared,threshold_met,false_positive
below_threshold,2,"test pattern A",task_complete,no,no,no
at_threshold,3,"test pattern B",task_complete,yes,yes,no
above_threshold,5,"test pattern C",task_complete,yes,yes,no
```

**Analysis**:

- Threshold accuracy = (correct detections / total scenarios) × 100
- Target: 100% (all thresholds detected correctly)

---

### Checkpoint Type Coverage (Test 0D)

**Execution**: Trigger each checkpoint type with pattern present

**Data Collection**:

```csv
checkpoint_type,pattern_present,proposal_appeared,timing_correct,notes
green_tdd,yes,[observe],[observe],"after test passes"
pr_created,yes,[observe],[observe],"after pr-create.sh"
task_complete,yes,[observe],[observe],"after todo_write status:completed"
wrap_up,yes,[observe],[observe],"after 'anything else?'"
```

**Analysis**:

- Checkpoint coverage = (checkpoints_with_proposals / checkpoints_with_patterns) × 100
- Target: >75% (at least 3 of 4 checkpoint types work)

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success (Rule Works)

**All of**:

- Proposal appeared at current checkpoint (Test 0B): ✅
- Threshold detection accurate (Test 0C): 100%
- Checkpoint coverage (Test 0D): ≥75%
- Format correct (all proposals have 4 fields): 100%
- Evidence accurate (file lists correct): >95%

**Conclusion**: Self-improve rule IS being followed

**Impact on Investigation**:

- Proves rules CAN enforce behavior
- Shifts focus to: Why git-usage fails when self-improve succeeds?
- Comparative analysis becomes critical
- Apply self-improve patterns to git-usage

---

### Partial Success (Rule Works Sometimes)

**Some of**:

- Proposals appear but not consistently: 30-70%
- Threshold sometimes accurate: 50-90%
- Some checkpoints work: 25-75%

**Conclusion**: Self-improve rule partially working

**Impact on Investigation**:

- Implementation has bugs or gaps
- Fix self-improve first, then use as model
- Debug: which parts work, which don't?
- Identify: structural differences between working and failing parts

---

### Failure (Rule Doesn't Work)

**None of**:

- No proposals appear: 0%
- No checkpoints trigger proposals: 0%
- No pattern detection evidence: none

**Conclusion**: Self-improve rule NOT being followed

**Impact on Investigation**:

- Fundamental enforcement failure
- Even alwaysApply: true + strong structure insufficient
- ALL hypotheses remain critical
- Focus shifts to: Can ANY rule be enforced?
- Consider: Platform limitations, external validation

---

- Platform investigation (are rules enforced at all?)
- External validation (logs, scripts, monitoring)

**Test Modifications**:

- Lower expectations for rule-based improvements

---

## Current Status: LIVE TEST IN PROGRESS

**Right Now**: We are in the observation window for Test 0B

**Patterns Present**:

1. ✅ Test plan document structure (5 files)
2. ✅ Measurement protocol templates (4+ files)
3. ✅ Success criteria format (5 files)
4. ✅ Implementation checklist format (5 files)

**Threshold**: ✅ Met (all >3 files)
