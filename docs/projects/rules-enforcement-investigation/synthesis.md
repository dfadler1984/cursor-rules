# Phase 6D: Synthesis — Enforcement Patterns & Recommendations

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Started**: 2025-10-16  
**Purpose**: Synthesize H1/H2/H3 results into actionable enforcement patterns for all rule types

---

## Executive Summary

**What We Validated**:

- ✅ AlwaysApply improves compliance (+6-11 points across metrics)
- ✅ Visible gates appear consistently (H2 monitoring)
- ✅ Visible queries implemented (H3 monitoring)
- ✅ Rules CAN work when properly loaded (meta-test confirmed)

**Key Finding**: AlwaysApply is effective but doesn't scale to all 25 conditional rules (+50% context cost). Need multiple enforcement patterns based on rule risk and characteristics.

**Decision Points**: See [decision-points.md](decision-points.md) for 6 areas requiring user judgment.

## Part 1: Results Analysis (Objective Data)

### H1: Conditional Attachment (AlwaysApply Fix)

**Validation**: 21 commits analyzed (2025-10-15 to 2025-10-16)

**Results**:

| Metric         | Baseline | Current | Change     | Target   | Status       |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Script usage   | 74%      | 80%     | +6 pts     | >90%     | ⚠️ Below     |
| TDD compliance | 72%      | 83%     | +11 pts    | >95%     | ⚠️ Below     |
| Branch naming  | 62%      | 60%     | -2 pts     | >90%     | ⚠️ Below     |
| **Overall**    | **68%**  | **74%** | **+6 pts** | **>90%** | **⚠️ Below** |

**Interpretation** (objective):

- AlwaysApply consistently improves compliance across metrics
- Improvement magnitude: +6 to +11 percentage points
- Current levels remain below target thresholds
- No metric regressed significantly (branch naming -2 likely noise)

**What this proves**:

- ✅ AlwaysApply is effective (improvement confirmed)
- ⚠️ AlwaysApply is insufficient alone (gap remains)
- ✅ Direction is correct (all metrics improved or stable)

**What this doesn't prove**:

- ❌ Whether 80% is "good enough" (**Decision D1**)
- ❌ What additional patterns would close the gap
- ❌ Whether effort to reach 90% is justified

---

### H2: Visible Send Gate (Preliminary Observations)

**Status**: Checkpoint 1 complete (100% visibility), ongoing monitoring

**Objective observations**:

- Gate checklist appears consistently in responses with actions
- Format is clean and scannable
- All 7 checklist items present
- No FAIL status observed yet (no revisions triggered)

**What we know**:

- ✅ Visible gate implementation works (appears consistently)
- 🔄 Compliance impact unknown (need operations testing gate items)
- 🔄 Blocking effectiveness unknown (no failures triggered yet)

**What we need**:

- More operations that exercise different gate items (git, terminal, testing, changeset)
- Sufficient sample to measure compliance improvement
- Observation of gate detecting and blocking violations

**Cannot objectively assess**:

- ❌ Does visible gate "feel" helpful? (subjective)
- ❌ Is checkpoint 1 sufficient or need full validation? (**Decision D3**)

---

### H3: Visible Query Protocol (Preliminary Observations)

**Status**: Implemented, passive accumulation

**Objective observations**:

- Query output format implemented ("Checked capabilities.mdc for X: [result]")
- Implementation present in assistant-git-usage.mdc
- No formal measurement yet (need git operations to trigger)

**What we know**:

- ✅ Visible query implementation exists
- 🔄 Execution frequency unknown (passive accumulation)
- 🔄 Compliance impact unknown

**What we need**:

- 10-20 git operations to measure query visibility
- Comparison of script usage before/after visible queries
- Analysis of query → script compliance correlation

**Cannot objectively assess**:

- ❌ Is passive observation sufficient? (**Decision D3**)
- ❌ Should we formally validate H3 or skip?

---

### Phase 6C: Slash Commands (Completed)

**Finding**: Runtime routing not viable (platform constraint)

**Objective facts**:

- ❌ Cursor's `/` prefix is for prompt templates, not message routing
- ✅ Platform design confirmed via user test + documentation
- 📝 Prompt templates approach unexplored (alternative design)

**What this means**:

- Runtime routing path closed
- Prompt templates remain potential alternative
- H1 at 80% reduces urgency for additional patterns

**Cannot objectively assess**:

- ❌ Is 80% sufficient to skip prompt templates? (**Decision D4**)
- ❌ Should we explore templates or defer?

---

## Part 2: Scalability Analysis (Objective Calculations)

### Context Cost by Approach

**Current state** (19 alwaysApply rules):

- Estimated token count: ~34,000 tokens (rules + front matter)
- Proportion of context: ~3.4% of 1M token window

**Scenario A: AlwaysApply for 5 Critical Rules**

- Rules: git-usage (✅ applied) + tdd-first-js + tdd-first-sh + testing + refactoring
- Additional cost: ~+10k tokens
- Total: ~44k tokens (~4.4% of context)
- **Feasibility**: ✅ Manageable

**Scenario B: AlwaysApply for All 25 Conditional Rules**

- Additional cost: ~+33k tokens (25 rules × avg ~1.3k tokens)
- Total: ~67k tokens (~6.7% of context)
- Increase: +97% context usage for rules
- **Feasibility**: ⚠️ Expensive, reduces headroom for code/history

**Scenario C: Selective AlwaysApply + Routing Improvements**

- Critical rules (5): alwaysApply (~44k tokens)
- High-risk rules (5): improved routing (no context cost)
- Medium/Low rules (15): current state (conditional attachment)
- Total: ~44k tokens (~4.4% of context)
- **Feasibility**: ✅ Balanced approach

**Objective interpretation**:

- Scenario A: Low cost, covers critical violations
- Scenario B: High cost, diminishing returns likely
- Scenario C: Moderate cost, targets known problems

**Cannot objectively decide**:

- ❌ Which scenario is "best"? (requires value judgment)
- ❌ Is context cost acceptable? (**Decision D5**)

## Part 3: Enforcement Pattern Catalog (Evidence-Based)

### Pattern 1: AlwaysApply (Validated)

**Effectiveness**: +6 to +11 percentage points improvement

**When to use**:

- Critical rules with frequent violations
- Rules needed across many contexts
- Rules where routing is unreliable

**Cost**: ~2k tokens per rule (avg)

**Validated example**: assistant-git-usage.mdc (74% → 80%)

**Candidates** (objective risk assessment):

1. ✅ assistant-git-usage.mdc — Already applied, validated
2. tdd-first-js.mdc — High-risk, 83% compliance (target: 95%)
3. tdd-first-sh.mdc — High-risk, implementation edits without tests
4. testing.mdc — High-risk, poor test quality observed
5. refactoring.mdc — High-risk, breaking changes without coverage

**Limitations**:

- Context cost limits scalability (~5 rules practical)
- Doesn't guarantee 100% compliance (80% achieved, not 90%)
- Still requires assistant awareness and execution

---

### Pattern 2: Visible Gates (Preliminary)

**Implementation**: Pre-send gate with explicit OUTPUT requirement

**Observations**:

- ✅ Gate appears consistently (100% visibility checkpoint 1)
- 🔄 Compliance impact not yet measured
- 🔄 Blocking effectiveness unknown

**When to use** (theoretical):

- Cross-cutting concerns (applies to all responses with actions)
- Multi-step validations (checklists before sending)
- Last-chance enforcement before output

**Cost**: Minimal (gate is small, already in alwaysApply rule)

**Needs validation**: Effectiveness at improving compliance

---

### Pattern 3: Visible Queries (Preliminary)

**Implementation**: Explicit OUTPUT of "Checked capabilities.mdc for X" before tool use

**Observations**:

- ✅ Implementation present in assistant-git-usage.mdc
- 🔄 Execution not yet observed (need git operations)
- 🔄 Compliance impact unknown

**When to use** (theoretical):

- Script-first policies where forgetting to check is common
- Any "check X before Y" protocol
- Transparency for user oversight

**Cost**: One line per query (minimal)

**Needs validation**: Does visibility improve check compliance?

---

### Pattern 4: Intent Routing (Current State)

**Effectiveness**: Works well for guidance/planning rules (anecdotal)

**When to use** (observed):

- Rules triggered by specific phrases (ERD creation, task generation)
- Guidance-only rules (not implementation gates)
- Low-frequency rules (rare contexts)

**Examples that work well**:

- create-erd.mdc — Triggered by "create ERD for X"
- guidance-first.mdc — Triggered by "how can we", "what's best"
- dry-run.mdc — Triggered by "DRY RUN:" prefix

**Limitations** (from violation analysis):

- Misses implicit operations (assistant-initiated git actions)
- Fails when similar concepts use different terms
- No enforcement for implementation gates

---

### Pattern 5: External Validation (Proven in Repo)

**Effectiveness**: 100% enforcement where implemented

**Examples**:

- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (local enforcement)
- ✅ CI checks (PR validation)
- ✅ Linters (automated fixes)

**When to use**:

- Deterministic checks (branch naming, commit format, lockfile sync)
- Artifact validation (test files exist, coverage thresholds)
- Final gates before merge

**Cost**: Setup + maintenance of automation

**Limitation**: Only checks artifacts, not assistant reasoning/awareness

---

## Part 4: Decision Tree Framework (Objective Structure)

```
For each rule, assess:

1. Risk Level (objective)
   ├─ Critical: Violations break workflows or safety
   ├─ High: Frequent violations or significant impact
   ├─ Medium: Context-dependent, moderate impact
   └─ Low: Infrequent triggers, guidance-only

2. Violation Evidence (objective)
   ├─ Confirmed: Observed in git history or investigation
   ├─ Suspected: Similar to violated rules
   └─ None: No known violations

3. Trigger Reliability (objective)
   ├─ Unreliable: Conditional attachment + implicit triggers
   ├─ Moderate: Phrase-based intent routing
   └─ Reliable: External validation or explicit user action

4. Context Cost (objective)
   ├─ ~2k tokens per rule for alwaysApply
   └─ 0 tokens for routing improvements

5. Enforcement Pattern [USER DECISION REQUIRED]
   ├─ AlwaysApply (if critical + unreliable + cost acceptable)
   ├─ Visible gate/query (if cross-cutting + low cost)
   ├─ Improved routing (if moderate risk + reliable triggers exist)
   ├─ External validation (if deterministic check possible)
   └─ Current state (if low risk + current routing sufficient)
```

**This framework provides**:

- ✅ Objective categorization (steps 1-4)
- ❌ Requires user decision for step 5 (**Decision D2**)

---

## Part 5: Conditional Rules Categorization (Objective Risk Assessment)

### Critical Risk (1 rule)

**1. assistant-git-usage.mdc** → ✅ FIXED (now alwaysApply: true)

- Violation evidence: Confirmed (26% non-compliance baseline)
- Trigger reliability: Unreliable (conditional + implicit git actions)
- Fix validated: 74% → 80% (+6 points)

### High Risk (4 rules)

**2. tdd-first-js.mdc** (JS/TS TDD pre-edit gate)

- Violation evidence: Confirmed (17% non-compliance)
- Trigger: globs `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}`
- Current compliance: 83% (target: 95%)
- Pattern: Same as git-usage (pre-action gate)
- **Candidate for alwaysApply** (step 5 needs user decision)

**3. tdd-first-sh.mdc** (Shell TDD pre-edit gate)

- Violation evidence: Suspected (shell scripts changed without tests)
- Trigger: globs `.cursor/scripts/*.sh`
- Pattern: Same as tdd-first-js
- **Candidate for alwaysApply** (step 5 needs user decision)

**4. testing.mdc** (Test structure and quality)

- Violation evidence: Suspected (weak assertions, missing owner coupling)
- Trigger: globs `**/*.spec*,**/*.test*`
- Pattern: Active during test file edits
- **Candidate for alwaysApply** (step 5 needs user decision)

**5. refactoring.mdc** (Refactoring safety)

- Violation evidence: Suspected (refactors without test coverage)
- Trigger: globs `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` + intent phrases
- Pattern: Pre-refactor checklist needed
- **Candidate for alwaysApply** (step 5 needs user decision)

### Medium Risk (7 rules)

**6. create-erd.mdc** (ERD creation workflow)

- Violation evidence: None (intent routing works well)
- Trigger: intent-routing phrases ("create ERD")
- Current state: Working well for guidance
- **Likely sufficient** (but needs user confirmation)

**7. generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc** (Task generation)

- Violation evidence: None (two-phase flow works)
- Trigger: intent-routing phrases ("generate tasks")
- Current state: Working well
- **Likely sufficient**

**8. project-lifecycle.mdc** (Project completion policy)

- Violation evidence: Confirmed (this project marked complete prematurely)
- Trigger: paths matching `docs/projects/**`
- Pattern: Validation checklist before archival
- **Improved routing or visible gate?** (user decision needed)

**9. spec-driven.mdc** (Specification workflow)

- Violation evidence: Suspected (skip planning phase)
- Trigger: intent-routing phrases ("plan", "specify")
- Pattern: Planning before implementation
- **Improved routing likely sufficient**

**10. guidance-first.mdc** (Guidance vs implementation)

- Violation evidence: Confirmed (over-implementation when guidance requested)
- Trigger: intent-routing phrases ("how can we", "what's best")
- Pattern: Intent classification
- **Improved routing likely sufficient**

**11. imports.mdc** (Import organization)

- Violation evidence: None (linter handles most cases)
- Trigger: globs `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}`
- Current state: Linter integration preferred
- **External validation preferred** (linter automation)

**12. shell-unix-philosophy.mdc** (Shell script design)

- Violation evidence: None (scripts follow philosophy)
- Trigger: globs `.cursor/scripts/**/*.sh`
- Current state: Review during script creation
- **Current state likely sufficient**

### Low Risk (13 rules)

_(Listing abbreviated for brevity)_

**13-25**: changelog, context-efficiency, deterministic-outputs, dry-run, five-whys, front-matter, github-config-only, github-api-usage, intent-routing, rule-creation, rule-maintenance, rule-quality, workspace-security

- All have: Low violation evidence, specific triggers, guidance-only or rare usage
- Current state: Conditional attachment working well
- **Current state sufficient** (but needs user confirmation for each)

## Part 6: Recommendations (Data-Driven, Decision-Flagged)

### Recommendation 1: Apply AlwaysApply to Critical Rules

**Objective data**:

- 5 rules identified (git-usage + 4 high-risk)
- Context cost: ~+10k tokens (~15% increase)
- Expected improvement: +6 to +11 points per rule (based on H1)

**Options**:

1. Apply to all 5 (maximize compliance, accept cost)
2. Apply to subset (e.g., just TDD rules)
3. Apply one at a time with validation (phased approach)
4. Skip (current state acceptable)

**🚩 User Decision Required**: See [decision-points.md](decision-points.md) **D5**

---

### Recommendation 2: Complete or Continue H2/H3 Validation

**Objective data**:

- H2: Checkpoint 1 complete (100% visibility)
- H3: Implementation complete, no formal measurement
- H1 at 80% reduces urgency for additional patterns
- Formal validation effort: ~1-2 weeks passive monitoring

**Options**:

1. Complete formal validation (wait for more checkpoints)
2. Accept preliminary observations (proceed to synthesis)
3. Defer H2/H3 (optional follow-up if 80% proves insufficient)

**🚩 User Decision Required**: See [decision-points.md](decision-points.md) **D3**

---

### Recommendation 3: Prompt Templates Exploration

**Objective data**:

- Runtime routing confirmed not viable
- Prompt templates approach unexplored (different design)
- Effort estimate: ~4-6 hours (design + test + validate)
- H1 at 80% may be sufficient without this

**Options**:

1. Explore prompt templates (create `/commit.md` etc.)
2. Defer indefinitely (80% sufficient)
3. Carryover (document for future if compliance drops)

**🚩 User Decision Required**: See [decision-points.md](decision-points.md) **D4**

---

### Recommendation 4: Medium/Low Rules - Accept Current State

**Objective data**:

- 20 rules with low/no violation evidence
- Intent routing working well for guidance rules
- External validation preferred for deterministic checks

**Options**:

1. Accept current state (conditional attachment sufficient)
2. Improve intent routing for specific rules (case-by-case)
3. Add external validation where possible (CI/hooks)

**Likely recommendation**: Accept current state for most; improve routing for project-lifecycle, guidance-first (confirmed violations)

**🚩 User Decision Required**: See [decision-points.md](decision-points.md) **D2** (per-rule assessment)

---

## Part 7: Next Steps (Pending User Decisions)

### If D1 = "Accept 80%"

1. Document current state as sufficient
2. Apply findings to similar repos/contexts
3. Mark investigation complete after synthesis + summary

### If D1 = "Pursue 90%"

1. Execute D2-D5 decisions (alwaysApply, H2/H3, templates)
2. Validate improvements with additional monitoring
3. Iterate until 90% achieved

### If D1 = "Partial"

1. Apply alwaysApply to subset of critical rules
2. Validate improvement
3. Reassess 80% → ?% → sufficient or continue

---
