## Observation

Discovered Cursor hooks system - global hooks work, project hooks may require restart

<!-- 
Factual description of what happened. Keep objective and minimal interpretation.
Examples:
- Created `project-archive-ready.sh` (255 lines) without test file
- User said "implement X", guidance rules attached instead of implementation rules
- Pre-send gate did not trigger despite TDD rule loaded
-->
