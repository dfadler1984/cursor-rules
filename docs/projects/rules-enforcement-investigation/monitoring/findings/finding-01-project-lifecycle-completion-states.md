# Gap #1: Project-Lifecycle Completion States Unclear

**Discovered**: 2025-10-15  
**Context**: Document consolidation  
**Severity**: Medium (caused confusion and wasted effort)

---

## Issue

No clear guidance on "complete but not archived" state

## Evidence

Confusion between ERD status, HANDOFF status, and actual completion

## Impact

Wasted effort creating/consolidating docs, unclear final-summary timing

## Recommendation

Clarify completion states, standardize transition docs

## Resolution

âœ… **Applied in Phase 1** (Task 15.0)

Updated `project-lifecycle.mdc`:

- Added "Complete (Active)" state definition
- Clarified when to archive vs keep active (4 criteria each)
- Added Pre-Closure Checklist (8 mandatory items)
- Added 7 explicit lifecycle stages
- Added validation periods section
