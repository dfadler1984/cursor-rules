# Finding 24: definitive-enforcement-limitation

**Project**: rules-enforcement-investigation  
**Severity**: critical  
**Status**: open  
**Source Logs**: 001,002

---

## Pattern

**Cursor Rules cannot mechanically enforce behavior** - they provide guidance/context but cannot block tool calls or force specific outputs.

**Evidence across multiple tests**:
- Pre-send gate rule requires "OUTPUT this checklist" → Never outputs
- TDD gate rule says "DO NOT SEND MESSAGE" → Continues sending  
- Hooks rule says "OUTPUT warning" → No warnings generated
- All rules have `alwaysApply: true` → Still not executed

<!-- 
Examples:
- "TDD pre-edit gate triggers on 'editing' but not 'creating' new files"
- "Intent routing attaches guidance rules when implementation was requested"
- "Pre-send gate bypassed when specific rule combinations are loaded"
- "Changeset policy violations occur during manual PR creation"
-->

## Evidence

[References to specific logs, with key facts]

**Supporting logs**:
- **log-001**: [Key fact from this log]
- **log-002**: [Key fact from this log]

**Key facts**:
- [Key fact 1]
- [Key fact 2]
- [Key fact 3]

<!-- 
Reference specific logs and extract the key facts that support this pattern.
Be specific about what each log contributed to the pattern recognition.
Include quantifiable data where possible (timestamps, file counts, etc.)
-->

## Root Cause

**Cursor Rules are reference material, not executable constraints.**

**Primary cause**: Platform architectural limitation - AI assistant cannot mechanically enforce rules on itself

**Technical explanation**: Rules provide context and guidance that influence responses, but cannot:
- Block tool calls from executing
- Force specific text output
- Halt message sending
- Mechanically validate parameters

**Contributing factors**:
- [Contributing factor 1]
- [Contributing factor 2]

**Why this happens**:
[Detailed explanation of the underlying mechanism]

<!-- 
Analysis of why this pattern occurs. Dig into the underlying reasons.
Examples:
- Rule text ambiguity ("editing" vs "creating")
- Missing enforcement mechanism (OUTPUT requirement not enforced)
- Timing issues (rule loaded after gate should trigger)
- Configuration conflicts (multiple rules with overlapping scope)
- Process gaps (manual steps bypassing automation)

## Impact

**Effect on project**: [Impact on this specific project]

**Effect on quality**: [Impact on overall system quality]

**Effect on compliance**: [Impact on rule compliance]

**Quantified impact**:
- [Quantified impact 1]
- [Quantified impact 2]

<!-- 
Assess the impact of this pattern on the project and broader system.
Examples:
- "13 TDD violations documented despite gate deployment"
- "95% of findings documented in wrong project before routing fix"
- "Average time to identify pattern: 5 days vs 1 day with better logging"
- "User correction required in 15% of routing decisions"
-->

## Recommendation

**Immediate actions**:
1. Update rules-enforcement-investigation: Mark Phases 6B/6C complete with "Platform limitation identified"
2. Pivot active-monitoring-formalization: Focus on external enforcement mechanisms
3. Document external enforcement options: Git hooks, CI scripts, manual validation

**Long-term improvements**:
- Implement git pre-commit hooks for TDD enforcement
- Create CI validation for script-first compliance
- Design external tools that validate rule compliance
- Consider Cursor platform enhancement requests

**Proposed changes**:
- **[Change target 1]**: [Change description 1]
- **[Change target 2]**: [Change description 2]

**Success criteria**:
- [Success criterion 1]
- [Success criterion 2]

<!-- 
Specific, actionable recommendations to address the root cause.
Include both immediate fixes and longer-term improvements.
Examples:
- "Update assistant-behavior.mdc line 290: change 'editing' to 'creating or editing'"
- "Add file pairing validation to TDD pre-edit gate"
- "Implement OUTPUT requirement enforcement in pre-send gate"
- "Create monitoring-validate-paths.sh to detect wrong-project findings"
