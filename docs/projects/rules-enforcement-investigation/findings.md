# Findings: Rules Enforcement Investigation

**Project**: rules-enforcement-investigation  
**Status**: ACTIVE (incorrectly marked complete on 2025-10-15)  
**Completion**: ~15%

---

## Status Correction

**What Was Claimed**: Investigation complete, root cause found, fix validated.

**What's Actually True**: One fix applied but NOT validated. Core research questions remain unanswered. The investigation prematurely declared success.

## Partial Finding: Conditional Attachment Is ONE Factor

**Factor Identified**: Conditional attachment (`alwaysApply: false` on git-usage rule)

**Fix Applied**: Changed `assistant-git-usage.mdc` to `alwaysApply: true`

**Evidence**: Meta-test with self-improve rule proved rules CAN work when `alwaysApply: true`

- Self-improve (alwaysApply: true) → ✅ Working
- Git-usage (alwaysApply: false) → ❌ Had violations

**Critical Gap**: This fix is NOT VALIDATED and NOT SCALABLE

- ❌ No validation with actual usage (need 20-30 commits)
- ❌ Baseline shows 71% script usage — fix may not reach 90% target
- ❌ Cannot apply `alwaysApply: true` to all 25 conditional rules (context bloat)
- ❌ Doesn't answer: what enforcement patterns SCALE?

---

## Research Questions: Status

### Partially Answered

- **Q3**: How to measure compliance objectively?  
  → ✅ **Automated checkers** (built and working)

- **Q4**: Why did violations occur?  
  → ⚠️ **Conditional attachment is ONE factor** (not the only factor, not validated)

### NOT Answered (Required)

- **Q1**: Are rules constraints or reference material?  
  → ⏸️ Partially: alwaysApply rules CAN constrain, but what about conditional rules?

- **Q2**: What creates forcing functions?  
  → ⏸️ Unknown: Checkpoints work (self-improve proves it), but do pre-send gates work? Do queries execute?

- **Q5**: Do slash commands create better forcing functions?  
  → ⏸️ Unknown: This is NOT optional — it may be the scalable solution for 25 conditional rules!

- **Q6**: Why don't pre-send gates work as well as checkpoints?  
  → ⏸️ Unknown: This is NOT understanding — it's critical to know which patterns work!

- **Q7**: Does visible query output improve enforcement?  
  → ⏸️ Unknown: Transparency → accountability → compliance (need to test)

- Created: `test-plan-template.mdc` (from pattern proposal)
- Validated: Rules-validate.sh passed

---

## Required Work (Incorrectly Marked "Optional")

These are NOT optional enhancements — they answer the fundamental research questions:

### Must Complete

1. **Validate H1 Fix** (20-30 commits)
   - Measure if alwaysApply actually improves compliance
   - Target: 71% → >90% script usage
2. **Hypothesis 2: Send Gate Enforcement**
   - Does pre-send gate execute?
   - Does it detect violations?
   - Does it BLOCK violations?
3. **Hypothesis 3: Query Visibility**
   - Is "check capabilities.mdc" executed?
   - Would visible output improve compliance?
4. **Slash Commands Experiment**
   - Can explicit commands solve routing for 25 conditional rules?
   - This is the SCALABLE solution candidate
5. **Synthesize Scalable Patterns**
   - Create decision tree for enforcement approaches
   - Document when to use: alwaysApply vs slash commands vs improved routing
6. **Complete 6 Rule Improvements**
   - Project-lifecycle completion states
   - Task document structure
   - ERD vs tasks separation
   - ERD scope definition
   - Summary document guidance
   - Self-improvement pattern detection

## Rule Gaps Discovered During Investigation

**Five rule gaps discovered** (meta-findings about project management rules):

**Pattern observed**: As we cleaned up the investigation, each cleanup step revealed another rule gap. This validates the investigation's finding that rules are easy to violate when process signals are missed.

### 1. Project-lifecycle.mdc unclear on completion states

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on "complete but not archived" state
- **Evidence**: Confusion between ERD status, HANDOFF status, and actual completion
- **Impact**: Wasted effort creating/consolidating docs, unclear final-summary timing
- **Recommendation**: Clarify completion states, standardize transition docs
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during document consolidation

### 2. Self-improvement pattern detection needs strengthening

- **Issue**: Observed rule gaps not proactively flagged as investigation evidence
- **Evidence**: Project-lifecycle gap noticed but not added to scope until user prompted
- **Impact**: Missed opportunity to capture first-class data during active investigation
- **Recommendation**: During rule investigations, treat observed issues as first-class data
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during handoff discussion

### 3. Task document structure not clearly defined

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on what belongs in tasks.md vs ERD vs other docs
- **Evidence**: tasks.md accumulated findings, questions, success criteria (152 lines non-task content)
- **Impact**: Tasks file became bloated with content that should be in ERD/README
- **Recommendation**: Define tasks.md as phase sections with checklists only; all other content in ERD
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during tasks.md cleanup

### 4. ERD vs tasks separation unclear for acceptance criteria

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on whether acceptance criteria checklists belong in ERD or tasks
- **Evidence**: ERD section 5 had acceptance criteria as checklists (should be in tasks.md)
- **Impact**: Duplication of checklist structure across files, unclear source of truth
- **Recommendation**: ERD describes acceptance criteria as narrative/requirements; tasks.md contains the actual checklists
- **Pattern**: ERD = requirements/what, tasks.md = execution/status
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `generate-tasks-from-erd.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during ERD review

### 5. ERD scope not clearly defined

- **Issue**: ERD accumulates findings, retrospective, and detailed execution plans beyond requirements
- **Evidence**: ERD section 11 (73 lines) contained findings/carryovers, not requirements; section 10 had detailed week-by-week timeline
- **Impact**: ERD becomes bloated (441 lines), hard to scan for actual requirements
- **Recommendation**: Define ERD scope clearly (requirements only); create separate findings.md for retrospective/outcomes
- **Pattern**: ERD = requirements/approach, findings.md = outcomes/retrospective, tasks.md = execution/status
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during ERD review

### 6. No guidance on summary document proliferation

- **Issue**: No clear guidance on when multiple summary documents are needed vs single entry point
- **Evidence**: Created 3 summary documents (README, BREAKTHROUGH, EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY) with 70-80% content overlap (all telling same story)
- **Impact**: Document proliferation (15 files), redundancy, unclear which doc is authoritative, wasted consolidation effort
- **Recommendation**: Define standard entry point (README.md); avoid multiple summaries unless distinct audiences require different formats
- **Pattern**: README.md = single entry point with navigation; specialized summaries only when justified by distinct audience needs
- **Files affected**: `project-lifecycle.mdc`, `create-erd.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-15 during summary consolidation

### 7. Documentation-before-execution pattern not automatic

- **Issue**: Asked "which execution mode?" before documenting test protocol; user had to point out protocol should be documented regardless
- **Evidence**: 2025-10-16 slash commands testing - proposed 3 execution modes but didn't document protocol first
- **Impact**: Violated plan-first principle; required user correction; missed opportunity to model good practice during investigation
- **Meta-observation**: Even while investigating rule enforcement, violated documentation-first pattern
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen self-improve.mdc to treat "should document first" as first-class trigger, not afterthought
- **Pattern**: Document → then choose execution; not "choose execution, maybe document"
- **Files affected**: `self-improve.mdc`, potentially `spec-driven.mdc`
- **Discovered**: 2025-10-16 during slash commands Phase 3 setup

## Investigation Meta-Lessons

### Self-Referential Validation

Even while investigating rule enforcement, rules were violated:

- Context efficiency (2/5 bloated → 4/5 lean after consolidation)
- Project lifecycle (unclear completion states)
- Document standards (scope creep, duplication)

**This validates the investigation's findings**: Rules are easy to violate when:

- Excitement/momentum overrides process
- Focused on content, miss process signals
- Incremental drift goes unnoticed
- Missing regular checkpoints (gauge updates)

### Pattern Improvement Observed

Self-improvement pattern strengthened during investigation:

- **Gap 1**: User prompted multiple times before capture
- **Gap 2**: User prompted once before capture
- **Gaps 3-5**: Captured immediately when user pointed them out ✅

The investigation itself became data for the investigation.

### Key Insights

1. **Meta-tests save massive time**: 5 minutes vs 4 weeks to answer fundamental question
2. **Empirical evidence > speculation**: Live observation beats theoretical analysis
3. **Simple fixes often best**: One-line change (alwaysApply: false → true) solved primary issue
4. **Pattern-based improvement works**: Self-improve detected test plan patterns and proposed standardization

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate Monitoring

- Monitor git-usage improvement (next 20-30 commits)
- Expected: Approach 100% conventional commits (vs 71% baseline)

### Rule Improvements

- Apply learnings to project-lifecycle.mdc (5 gaps documented)
- Apply learnings to self-improvement patterns
- Consider broader audit of conditional rules

### Additional Understanding

- Execute deferred tests if additional understanding needed (H2, H3, slash commands)
- Each provides deeper insight but not critical to primary finding

---

## Retrospective: Why Was This Marked Complete?

**Pattern**: Excitement/momentum overrode process — exactly what the investigation discovered!

**Evidence**:

- Applied one fix without validation
- Declared victory without testing
- Deferred core research questions as "optional"
- Ignored scalability concern (25 conditional rules)
- Marked complete with 6 substantive findings incomplete

**Irony**: The investigation violated the same patterns it was investigating — rules are easy to violate when process signals are missed.

**Correction Applied**: 2025-10-15 — Status reverted to ACTIVE, remaining work clearly scoped.

---

**Current Status**: Investigation ~15% complete  
**Next Phase**: Validate H1 fix, then execute H2/H3/slash commands  
**Value Delivered So Far**: Measurement tools + baseline metrics + proof that rules CAN work
