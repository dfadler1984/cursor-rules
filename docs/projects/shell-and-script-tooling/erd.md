# Engineering Requirements Document — Shell & Script Tooling (Unified)

Links: `docs/projects/shell-and-script-tooling/tasks.md`

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Unify and coordinate shell/script-related initiatives across the repository by referencing existing projects without moving files. This project provides a single place to align goals, reduce duplication, and track cross-cutting decisions while each source project remains authoritative for its own scope.

**Source projects:** 10 (9 original + tests-github-deletion added 2025-10-13)

## 2. Scope & Approach

- Reference, do not move: Source projects remain as-is and authoritative.
- Dual tracking: Track relevant work both here (for consolidation visibility) and within each source project (for local ownership).
- Derive unique unified tasks as other projects progress; avoid premature merging.

## 3. Source Projects (authoritative references)

- Bash Script Standards — `docs/projects/bash-scripts/erd.md` | tasks: `docs/projects/bash-scripts/tasks.md`
- Shell Scripts Suite — `docs/projects/_archived/2025/shell-scripts/final-summary.md` | **Completed 2025-10-11**
- Scripts & Unix Philosophy — `docs/projects/scripts-unix-philosophy/erd.md` | tasks: `docs/projects/scripts-unix-philosophy/tasks.md`
- Script Rules (best practices) — `docs/projects/script-rules/erd.md` | tasks: `docs/projects/script-rules/tasks.md`

- Tests GitHub Deletion — `docs/projects/tests-github-deletion/erd.md` | tasks: `docs/projects/tests-github-deletion/tasks.md` | **Note: Actively experiencing this issue (tmp-scan/ appeared during session)**

## 4. Goals/Objectives

- Provide a cohesive vision spanning standards, help UX, predictable errors, tests, linting, and offline capability.
- Reduce duplication and contradictions across script-related projects.
- Establish a small set of shared, adoption-ready decisions that individual suites can opt into.
- Maintain project-level autonomy while enabling cross-project coordination.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Reference Integration

- Each source project link must be present (ERD + tasks) and kept current.
- This ERD may define cross-cutting decisions; adoptions occur in source projects with explicit links back here.

### 5.2 Tracking & Synchronization

- When creating a unified task here, add a corresponding entry or link in the relevant source project tasks.
- Include backlinks: from source tasks to this ERD (section or task) for traceability.

### 5.3 Governance & Ownership

- Owner: rules-maintainers
- Decision notes recorded as short entries with date, scope, and impacted projects.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

**Phase 1-2 (Complete ✅):**

- [x] This ERD exists with links to all ten source projects and their tasks.
- [x] A unified tasks file exists, describing migration/derivation workflow and dual-tracking policy.
- [x] Projects index updated to include this unified project.
- [x] Cross-cutting decisions D1-D5 documented.
- [x] Core libraries implemented: `.lib.sh` enhancements, `.lib-net.sh` seam.
- [x] Validators created: `network-guard.sh`, `help-validate.sh`, `error-validate.sh`.
- [x] ShellCheck runner with portability guarantees.

**Phase 3 (Complete ✅):**

- [x] All network-using scripts migrated to networkless (4/4 scripts).
- [x] Network guard validator: 100% compliant (0 violations).
- [x] Error validation: 100% compliant (strict mode).
- [x] Test coverage: 52 tests, 100% passing.

**Phase 4 (In Progress):**

- [ ] Help documentation migration (31 of 32 scripts remain).
- [x] Migration pattern established (context-efficiency-gauge.sh example).

**Phase 5-6 (Future):**

- [ ] Documentation and CI integration.
- [ ] Source project adoption tracking.

## 7. Risks/Edge Cases

- Drift between unified guidance and project specifics — mitigated by explicit backlinks and minimal shared decisions.
- Over-centralization — mitigated by keeping source projects authoritative and adopting changes opt-in.

## 8. Rollout

- Comms: Link this project from the projects index once validated.
- Iteration: Start by referencing; derive unified tasks as individual projects progress.

## 9. Validation

- Manual check: all links resolve locally.
- Cross-reference check: new decisions recorded here have corresponding adoption notes in source projects.

## 10. Cross-cutting Decisions (Draft)

These proposals centralize defaults; adoptions occur in source projects with explicit backlinks.

### D1 — Help/Version Minimums and Section Schema

- Minimum flags: `-h|--help`, `--version` required for all maintained scripts.
- Help sections: Name, Synopsis, Description, Options, Environment, Examples, Exit Codes.
- Reference: `docs/projects/script-help-generation/erd.md` (validator/generator authority).

### D2 — Strict Mode Baseline and Traps

- Require sourcing `.cursor/scripts/.lib.sh` and calling `enable_strict_mode` or equivalent.
- Safety: `set -Eeuo pipefail`, sane `IFS`, default `ERR` trap with script:line print.
- Reference: `docs/projects/script-error-handling/erd.md` (helpers and validator).

### D3 — Error Semantics and Exit Code Catalog

- Reserve codes: 2 usage, 3 config, 4 dependency missing, 5 network failure, 6 timeout, 20 internal.
- User-facing failures use a `die` helper; concise stderr lines; stdout remains machine-output only.
- Reference: `docs/projects/script-error-handling/erd.md`.

### D4 — Networkless Effects Seam Defaults

- Introduce `.cursor/scripts/.lib-net.sh` with `net_request` that never performs HTTP.
- Require fixtures/guidance instead of live requests; honor `CURL_BIN=false`, `HTTP_BIN=false`.
- Reference: `docs/projects/networkless-scripts/erd.md`.

### D5 — Dependency Portability Policy

- Required dependencies: `bash` (≥4.0), `git` (when in repo context).
- Optional dependencies with graceful degradation: `jq`, `column`, `shellcheck`.
  - Pattern: `have_cmd <tool> || { log_warn "...; skipping/degrading"; exit 0; }`
  - Scripts must function (possibly with reduced UX) when optional deps are absent.
- Forbidden direct usage: network clients (`curl`, `wget`, `gh`, `http`) — must use `.lib-net.sh` seam.
- CI/validation tools: may require additional deps but must document and handle absence gracefully.
- Portability targets: macOS (Darwin) primary; prefer POSIX-sh compatible patterns where feasible.
- Reference: this ERD (authoritative for cross-project dependency policy).

Adoption workflow:

- Record each adoption under `docs/projects/<source>/tasks.md` with a backlink to this section and status.
- Keep source ERDs authoritative for detailed behavior and validators.

## 11. Future Considerations

### Script Directory Organization

As the script collection grows (64+ scripts currently), a flat `.cursor/scripts/` directory becomes difficult to navigate. After Phase 3 migrations stabilize, organize scripts into logical subdirectories based on functional groupings.

Proposed structure:

- `.cursor/scripts/git/` — Git workflow helpers (commits, branches, PRs, checks)
- `.cursor/scripts/project/` — Project lifecycle, archival, validation
- `.cursor/scripts/rules/` — Rules validation, listing, attachment, capabilities sync
- `.cursor/scripts/tests/` — Test runners, harnesses, and `fixtures/`
- `.cursor/scripts/lib/` or `.cursor/scripts/_lib/` — Shared libraries (`.lib.sh`, `.lib-net.sh`)

Migration requirements:

- Update all script path references in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- Update CI workflow paths and `.gitignore` patterns
- Add compatibility shims for public entrypoints if needed
- Validate with smoke tests and lifecycle validators

Timing: Defer until Phase 3 migrations complete to avoid churn and allow real usage patterns to inform final groupings.
