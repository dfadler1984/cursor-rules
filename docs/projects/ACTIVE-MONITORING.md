# Active Project Monitoring

**Purpose**: Track which projects are actively monitoring for issues and where to document findings  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23

## How to Use This File

**Before documenting a finding**, ask:

1. **What failed?**

   - Routing: Wrong rules attached?
   - Execution: Right rules attached but ignored?
   - Workflow: Automation contradiction?
   - Other: Different category?

2. **Which project monitors this?**

   - Check the table below
   - Match failure category to project scope

3. **Where to document?**
   - Use the "Findings Location" from the matching project
   - Follow the naming pattern specified
   - Cross-reference from other projects if relevant

## Project Scope Quick Reference

### Routing vs Execution

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| User says "implement X", guidance attached | Routing      | routing-optimization            | Intent misread, wrong rules attached                      |
| User says "implement X", TDD rule ignored  | Execution    | rules-enforcement-investigation | Rule loaded but pre-edit gate skipped                     |
| File signal overrides user intent          | Routing      | routing-optimization            | Editing test file + ask guidance ‚Üí testing rules attached |
| AlwaysApply rule present but violated      | Execution    | rules-enforcement-investigation | self-improve.mdc loaded, "don't wait" ignored             |

### Workflow vs Behavior

| **Symptom**                              | **Category** | **Project**                     | **Example**                                           |

| GitHub Action auto-labels incorrectly    | Workflow     | github-workflows-utility        | Auto-applies skip-changeset despite changeset present |
| PR script doesn't handle flags correctly | Workflow     | pr-create-decomposition         | Script missing --with-changeset flag                  |
| Assistant doesn't use repo script        | Execution    | rules-enforcement-investigation | Used manual git command instead of git-commit.sh      |

## Adding New Monitoring Projects

When starting new investigation/monitoring project:

1. **Update this file**:

   - Add project to "Currently Active Monitoring" section
   - Specify scope, findings location, pattern
   - Define "Out of Scope" explicitly

2. **Update project README/tasks**:

   - Add "Monitoring Status" section
   - Link to this file for disambiguation

3. **Cross-reference**:
   - Link related monitoring projects
   - Clarify boundaries between them

**Purpose**: Prevent cross-project confusion and ensure findings documented in correct location  
**Audience**: Assistant (primary), maintainers (secondary)  
**Updates**: Add projects when new monitoring starts; mark complete when monitoring ends
