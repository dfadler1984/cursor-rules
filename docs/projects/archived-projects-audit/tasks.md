## Tasks — Archived Projects Audit

**Status**: ACTIVE | Phase: 2 Complete → Phase 3 (Full Audit) | ~40% Complete

---

## Phase 1: Sample Review & Methodology Validation

- [x] 1.0 Setup

  - [x] 1.1 Create project structure (README, ERD, tasks)
  - [x] 1.2 Define audit checklist
  - [x] 1.3 Select 5 sample projects (most recent)

- [x] 2.0 Sample Project Audits

  - [x] 2.1 Audit Project 1: `slash-commands-runtime` (3 findings)
  - [x] 2.2 Audit Project 2: `productivity` (1 finding)
  - [x] 2.3 Audit Project 3: `collaboration-options` (2 findings)
  - [x] 2.4 Audit Project 4: `ai-workflow-integration` (2 findings)
  - [x] 2.5 Audit Project 5: `core-values` (2 findings)

- [x] 3.0 Methodology Validation
  - [x] 3.1 Count total findings from Phase 1 (10 findings total)
  - [x] 3.2 If <3 findings: Review audit criteria for gaps (✅ PASS: 10 findings, no review needed)
  - [x] 3.3 Adjust methodology if needed (No adjustments needed; methodology effective)
  - [x] 3.4 Document methodology refinements (Phase 1 summary created)

## Phase 2: Template Validation & Backfilling

- [x] 4.0 Final Summary Template Validation

  - [x] 4.1 Check all Phase 1 projects for unfilled templates (2 found: slash-commands-runtime, collaboration-options)
  - [x] 4.2 Backfill `slash-commands-runtime/final-summary.md` from PROJECT-SUMMARY.md or git history
  - [x] 4.3 Backfill `collaboration-options/final-summary.md` from git history/ERD
  - [x] 4.4 Document template filling process (recorded in audit findings)

- [x] 5.0 Validation Rule Enhancement
  - [x] 5.1 Update project-lifecycle validation script to detect unfilled templates
  - [x] 5.2 Add template placeholder detection (regex for `<...>` markers)
  - [x] 5.3 Test validation on Phase 1 projects (all pass after backfilling)
  - [ ] 5.4 Document validation enhancement in project-lifecycle.mdc

## Phase 3: Full Audit (After Template Fixes)

- [ ] 6.0 Remaining Project Audits

  - [ ] 6.1 List all remaining archived projects
  - [ ] 6.2 Audit remaining projects (batch by 5)
  - [ ] 6.3 Backfill any additional incomplete templates found

- [ ] 7.0 Pattern Analysis
  - [ ] 7.1 Identify common incomplete tasks
  - [ ] 7.2 Identify common migration gaps
  - [ ] 7.3 Document patterns in findings

## Phase 4: Remediation (Pending Phase 3 Completion)

- [ ] 8.0 Remediation Planning

  - [ ] 8.1 Categorize findings (quick fix vs deferred)
  - [ ] 8.2 Create remediation tasks
  - [ ] 8.3 Prioritize fixes

- [ ] 9.0 Execute Remediation

  - [ ] 9.1 Fix critical gaps (missing migrations)
  - [ ] 9.2 Update task states (carryovers)
  - [ ] 9.3 Fix broken references

- [ ] 10.0 Process Improvements
  - [ ] 10.1 Create reusable audit checklist
  - [ ] 10.2 Propose archival workflow improvements
  - [ ] 10.3 Update project-lifecycle.mdc if needed

## Carryovers

(Optional tasks deferred to future work)
