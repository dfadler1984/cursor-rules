# Phase 1 Deployment Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED  
**Next**: User validation testing (Phase 2)

---

## Changes Deployed

### 1. Scope Expansion (Line 354)

**Before**:

```markdown
- Before editing any maintained source...
```

**After**:

```markdown
- Before creating or editing any maintained source...
```

**Impact**: TDD gate now triggers for NEW file creation (fixes scope gap)

---

### 2. Pre-Send Gate TDD Check (Line 290)

**Before**:

```markdown
- [ ] TDD: spec updated? (if impl edits)
```

**After**:

```markdown
- [ ] TDD: test file exists? (if creating/editing impl sources)
```

**Impact**: Clearer wording, covers creation + editing explicitly

---

### 3. File Pairing Validation (Lines 311-320)

**Before**:

```markdown
- **TDD gate**: for implementation edits, owner spec added/updated
  (Red → Green → Refactor) or explicit blocker stated.
```

**After**:

```markdown
- **TDD gate**: for implementation sources, test file must exist or be created in same batch.
  - File pairing required:
    - Creating/editing `*.sh` → `*.test.sh` must exist or be in same batch
    - Creating/editing `*.ts` (not `*.mdc`) → `*.test.ts` OR `*.spec.ts` must exist or be in same batch
    - Creating/editing `*.tsx` → `*.test.tsx` OR `*.spec.tsx` must exist or be in same batch
  - Exemptions: `*.mdc`, `*.md`, `.lib*.sh`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*.config.*`
  - If source file without test file: Gate = FAIL
  - FAIL action: DO NOT SEND MESSAGE, show error with file name and expected test file
  - Error template: "Cannot create/edit <file> without test file. Create <test-file> first (Red → Green → Refactor)."
  - No exceptions: Test file requirement is absolute (no "or explicit blocker" escape hatch)
```

**Impact**:

- ✅ Specific file patterns defined
- ✅ Exemptions clearly listed
- ✅ Escape hatch removed ("or explicit blocker stated" → deleted)
- ✅ FAIL behavior specified (DO NOT SEND MESSAGE)
- ✅ Error template provided

---

### 4. Blocking Enforcement Documentation (Lines 343-350)

**Added**:

```markdown
**File pairing enforcement** (Gap #22 validated):

- Creating/editing impl sources requires test file present or in same batch
- Scope gap fixed: Covers both "creating" AND "editing" (not just editing)
- Escape hatch removed: No "or explicit blocker" bypass
- Mechanical prevention: FAIL = message blocked, must create test first
- Pattern validated: Gaps #18, #22 were NEW file creation without tests → gate didn't trigger
- Solution deployed: Gate now covers file creation, prevents TDD violations mechanically
```

**Impact**: Documents Gap #22 fix and enforcement mechanism

---

## What This Should Prevent

**Scenario**: Assistant attempts to create `.cursor/scripts/new-feature.sh` without tests

**Expected Flow**:

1. Assistant prepares message with `write` tool call for `new-feature.sh`
2. Pre-send gate runs
3. TDD check: "if creating/editing impl sources" → **TRIGGERED** (creating \*.sh file)
4. File pairing check: `new-feature.test.sh` exists? **NO**
5. Gate = **FAIL**
6. **Message BLOCKED** (not sent)
7. Error shown: "Cannot create new-feature.sh without test file. Create new-feature.test.sh first (Red → Green → Refactor)."
8. Assistant must revise: create test file first
9. Re-run pre-send gate
10. TDD check: test file exists? **YES**
11. Gate = **PASS**
12. Message sent, files created

---

## Testing Paradox

**Challenge**: I cannot test whether this blocking works because:

- If it works correctly, it will block THIS message from being sent
- If this message sends, the blocking didn't work
- Self-testing blocking gates is impossible

**Solution**: User must test scenarios or we monitor over time

---

## User Validation Request

To validate the blocking enforcement works, please test **Scenario 1**:

**Request**: "Create `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.sh` that prints hello world"

**Expected behavior**:

- ❌ Pre-send gate should FAIL
- ❌ Message should be BLOCKED (not sent)
- ❌ Error should show: "Cannot create test-blocking.sh without test file. Create test-blocking.test.sh first"

**If this happens**: Blocking enforcement is working! ✅

**If file gets created anyway**: Blocking enforcement failed, needs debugging ❌

---

## Monitoring Plan

**If user testing unavailable**:

- Monitor TDD violations over 1 week
- Track file creations (target: ≥20)
- Count violations (target: 0)
- Calculate: Violation rate = violations / creations
- Success: 0 violations over 1 week

---

## Next Steps

1. **User test Scenario 1** (immediate validation)
2. **Monitor for 1 week** (statistical validation)
3. **Collect metrics** (violations, false positives)
4. **Adjust exemptions** if false positives found
5. **Document results** in Phase 3

---

**Phase 1**: ✅ DEPLOYED (2025-10-24)  
**Blocking mechanism**: File pairing validation in pre-send gate  
**Scope fixed**: Covers creating + editing (not just editing)  
**Escape hatch**: Removed (absolute requirement)  
**Next**: User validation testing (Phase 2)
