# Phase 2 Evidence: Gap #23 (TDD Violation After Gate Deployment)

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Type**: Real-world validation (unintentional)  
**Significance**: First violation after deploying blocking TDD enforcement

---

## What Happened

**5 minutes after deploying blocking TDD enforcement**, violated TDD again:

**Timeline**:
- **08:00**: Deployed Gap #22 fix (file pairing validation in pre-send gate)
- **08:05**: User requested artifact detection feature for archival script
- **08:05**: Modified `project-archive-ready.sh` (added `check_active_artifacts()` function)
- **08:10**: Added test `test_detects_active_artifacts()` (AFTER implementation)
- **08:10**: User caught it: "Did you provide tests for the script you just created?"

**Violation Type**: Modified existing file without writing test FIRST

---

## Why This Matters for Phase 2

**This is NOT a test failure - it's validation data**:

### Finding: Current Gate Has Scope Gap

**What gate checks**: ✅ File existence ("does *.test.sh exist?")  
**What gate DOESN'T check**: ❌ Temporal ordering ("was test updated FIRST?")

**Evidence**:
- `project-archive-ready.sh` modified (implementation added)
- `project-archive-ready.test.sh` existed (gate check passed)
- But test not updated FIRST (TDD violated)
- **Gate passed when it should have failed**

### Gap Identified: Edit Detection vs Test-First Enforcement

**Current gate**:
```markdown
- Creating/editing *.sh → *.test.sh must exist or be in same batch
- If source file without test file: Gate = FAIL
```

**Gap**: 
- ✅ Detects: Creating file without test
- ❌ Doesn't detect: Editing file without updating test FIRST
- **Missing**: Temporal ordering (test before impl)

---

## Impact on Phase 2 Testing

### Test Scenario 6 (NEW - Must Add)

**User request**: "Add a new function to project-archive-ready.sh"

**Expected behavior**:
- ❌ Should FAIL if test not updated first
- ❌ Should require: Update test file BEFORE editing source
- ❌ Should enforce: Red → Green cycle, not just file existence

**Current behavior** (Gap #23 evidence):
- ✅ Gate checks file existence → PASS (test file exists)
- ✅ Allows source modification
- ❌ Doesn't enforce test-first ordering

**Conclusion**: **Blocking gate has second gap** (temporal ordering)

---

## Root Cause

### Why Gate Didn't Block Gap #23

**Gate implementation** (lines 311-320 in assistant-behavior.mdc):
```markdown
- File pairing required:
  - Creating/editing `*.sh` → `*.test.sh` must exist or be in same batch
- If source file without test file: Gate = FAIL
```

**Problem**: "must exist" is satisfied by pre-existing test file  
**Doesn't check**: Was test file MODIFIED in this turn?  
**Doesn't enforce**: Test modification before source modification

**Example**:
- `foo.sh` exists with `foo.test.sh` (both created previously)
- I edit `foo.sh` to add feature
- Gate checks: `foo.test.sh` exists? YES → PASS
- **But**: `foo.test.sh` not updated with new test → TDD violated
- **Gate passed when it should have failed**

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Batch Modification Check (Recommended)

**Enhanced gate**:
```markdown
- **TDD gate**: for implementation sources, test file must be modified when source is modified.
  - If editing *.sh → *.test.sh must be EDITED in same message
  - File existence alone insufficient for edits
  - If source modified but test not modified: Gate = FAIL
  - Exception: Refactoring (require test run evidence showing green)
```

**What it prevents**:
- ✅ Gap #22: Creating file without test
- ✅ Gap #23: Editing file without updating test

---

### Option 2: Tool Call Order Validation

**Track tool call sequence**:
```markdown
- If both source and test modified in message:
  - Verify test file tool call comes BEFORE source file tool call
  - Enforce: Red (test) → Green (impl) ordering
  - If source modified before test: Gate = FAIL
```

**What it prevents**:
- ✅ Gap #22: Creating file without test
- ✅ Gap #23: Editing file without test
- ✅ Additional: Impl-before-test in same message

---

## Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Document Gap #23 (this file)
2. ✅ Add to blocking-tdd-enforcement Phase 2 evidence
3. [ ] Update Phase 2 test scenarios (add Scenario 6)
4. [ ] Enhance gate implementation (Option 1 recommended)
5. [ ] Re-test after enhancement

---

## Updated Phase 2 Test Scenarios

**Add Scenario 6**:

**User request**: "Add a function to `.cursor/scripts/project-archive-ready.sh`"

**Current behavior** (Gap #23):
- Gate checks: `project-archive-ready.test.sh` exists? YES
- Gate: PASS
- Allows: Source modification
- **Violation**: TDD not enforced

**Expected behavior** (after fix):
- Gate checks: `project-archive-ready.test.sh` modified in this message? NO
- Gate: FAIL
- Error: "Must update test file before implementation. Add failing test first (Red → Green → Refactor)"

---

## Statistics

**Violations since investigation started**: 13 total
- Gaps #7-22: Before blocking gate deployed
- **Gap #23**: After blocking gate deployed (5 minutes later!)

**Blocking gate effectiveness**:
- File creation: Not tested yet (Phase 2 pending)
- File modification: **FAILED** (Gap #23 not caught)

**Conclusion**: Current gate design incomplete

---

## Validation of Gap #22 Findings

**Gap #22 conclusion**: "Scope gap - editing vs creating"

**Gap #23 validates**: Scope wasn't the only problem
- Fixed: File creation coverage ✅
- **Still broken**: Temporal ordering ❌
- **Still broken**: Edit-first detection ❌

**New understanding**:
- Need: File pairing (✅ deployed)
- Need: Temporal ordering (❌ not deployed)
- Need: Modification tracking (❌ not deployed)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (blocking-tdd-enforcement Phase 2)

1. Document Gap #23 as Phase 2 evidence
2. Update test scenarios to include file modification (Scenario 6)
3. Acknowledge: Phase 1 fix was partial, not complete

### Short-term (Phase 1.5 - Enhancement)

1. Implement Option 1: Batch modification check
2. Enhance gate: Require test modification when source modified
3. Test with Scenario 6

### Long-term (Phase 3+)

1. Consider Option 2: Temporal ordering validation
2. Track tool call sequence
3. Enforce Red → Green ordering

---

**Status**: Documented as Phase 2 evidence  
**Impact**: Proves Phase 1 fix incomplete (file existence ≠ test-first enforcement)  
**Next**: Enhance gate to check modifications, not just existence  
**Priority**: Critical (blocking-tdd-enforcement incomplete without this)
