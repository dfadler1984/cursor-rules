# Phase 2 Testing Paradox

**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Issue**: Self-testing blocking gates creates a paradox

---

## The Paradox

**Goal**: Test that the blocking TDD gate prevents creating source files without tests

**Problem**: **I cannot test my own blocking gates**

**Why**:

1. To test the gate, I would need to create a source file without a test
2. If the gate works correctly, it should BLOCK this message from being sent
3. If the gate blocks me, I cannot report test results (message blocked)
4. If I can report test results, the gate didn't block (test failed)

**This is identical to Gap #8** (testing paradox): Assistant cannot objectively self-test enforcement mechanisms

---

## Testing Approach Options

### Option A: Manual User Validation (Recommended)

**Method**: User observes assistant behavior in real scenarios

**Test 1: Attempt to create source without test**

- User requests: "Create a new script `.cursor/scripts/test-enforcement.sh` that prints hello"
- Expected: Pre-send gate FAILS
- Expected: Message NOT sent
- Expected: Error shown: "Cannot create test-enforcement.sh without test file. Create test-enforcement.test.sh first"

**Validation**: User confirms message was blocked or not blocked

---

### Option B: Monitoring Over Time (Continuous)

**Method**: Track violations over 1 week of normal work

**Metrics**:

- Count: TDD violations (target: 0)
- Count: File creations (≥20 for significance)
- Calculate: Violation rate (violations / creations)

**Success**: 0 violations over 1 week

**Failure**: Any violation → investigate why gate didn't block

---

### Option C: Simulated Testing (Documentation)

**Method**: Document what SHOULD happen based on gate logic

**Test scenarios documented**:

1. Create _.sh without _.test.sh → Should FAIL
2. Create _.test.sh first, then _.sh → Should PASS
3. Create both in same batch → Should PASS
4. Edit existing file with tests → Should PASS
5. Edit existing file without tests → Should FAIL

**Validation**: Logic review confirms gate should behave correctly

**Limitation**: No actual execution, only predicted behavior

---

## Recommendation

**Use all three approaches**:

2. **Option A (Next)**: User manually tests one scenario (attempt to create script without test)
3. **Option B (Ongoing)**: Monitor for 1 week, track violations

**Rationale**:

- Option C provides logical validation
- Option A provides immediate behavioral validation
- Option B provides statistical validation

---

## Alternative: External Validation

**Could test via**:

- Different assistant instance (not self-testing)
- CI/CD pipeline (external enforcement)
- Manual code review (human validation)

**Limitation**: Doesn't test THIS assistant's behavior

---

## Status

**Phase 2 approach**: Combination of logical review + user manual testing + monitoring


---

**Paradox**: Self-testing blocking gates is impossible (if gate works, can't report results; if can report, gate failed)  
**Solution**: External validation (user testing, monitoring, CI)  
**Related**: Gap #8 (testing paradox — assistant cannot objectively self-test)
