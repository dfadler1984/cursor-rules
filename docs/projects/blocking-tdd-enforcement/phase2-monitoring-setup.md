# Phase 2 Monitoring Setup

**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Purpose**: Infrastructure for tracking TDD gate blocking effectiveness  
**Duration**: 1 week (2025-10-24 to 2025-10-31)

---

## Monitoring Metrics

### Primary Metrics

**TDD Violations**:

- Definition: Creating/editing impl source without test file
- Target: 0 violations over 1 week
- Measurement: Count violations when observed
- Success: 0 violations

**False Positives**:

- Definition: Legitimate file blocked by gate
- Target: <1% of file operations
- Measurement: Count legitimate files blocked / total operations
- Success: <1%

**Gate Trigger Accuracy**:

- Definition: Gate triggers for correct file patterns
- Target: 100% accuracy
- Patterns: `*.sh`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx` (not `*.mdc`, `*.md`, etc.)
- Success: All impl sources trigger, all docs/configs exempt

**Batch Creation Handling**:

- Definition: Creating source + test in same turn passes
- Target: 100% success rate
- Success: All batch creations allowed

**Error Message Clarity**:

- Definition: Error messages are clear and actionable
- Target: User can understand and fix immediately
- Success: No confusion about what's needed

## Tracking Template

### Violation Log

```markdown
## TDD Violation [Date]

**File**: <path>
**Type**: Creating new | Editing existing
**Gate behavior**: Blocked ✅ | Allowed ❌
**Expected**: Should block
**Actual**: [what happened]
**Root cause**: [why gate didn't block if failed]
```

### False Positive Log

```markdown
## False Positive [Date]

**File**: <path>
**Type**: <_.mdc | _.md | config | other>
**Gate behavior**: Blocked ❌
**Expected**: Should allow (exempt)
**Actual**: Blocked incorrectly
**Action**: Add to exemptions list
```

### Success Log

```markdown
## Successful Block [Date]

**Attempt**: Create <file> without test
**Gate behavior**: Blocked ✅
**Error shown**: <error message>
**User action**: Created test first
**Result**: Proper TDD cycle followed
```

---

## Monitoring Approach

### Week 1 (2025-10-24 to 2025-10-31)

**Daily tracking**:

- Note any file creation/editing operations
- Check: Was test file present or created?
- Record: Gate blocked correctly or violation occurred
- Document: Any false positives

**Weekly aggregation**:

- Total file operations: ?
- TDD violations: ? (target: 0)
- False positives: ? (target: <1%)
- Gate accuracy: ? (target: 100%)

---

## Test Scenarios (User-Executed)

### Scenario 1: Create Source Without Test (Should FAIL)

**User request**: "Create `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.sh` that prints hello world"

**Expected flow**:

1. Assistant prepares `write` tool call for `test-blocking.sh`
2. Pre-send gate runs
3. TDD check: "if creating/editing impl sources" → TRIGGERED
4. File pairing: `test-blocking.test.sh` exists? NO
5. Gate = FAIL
6. **Message BLOCKED**
7. Error shown: "Cannot create test-blocking.sh without test file. Create test-blocking.test.sh first (Red → Green → Refactor)."

**Validation**: Message NOT sent, error shown, no file created

---

### Scenario 2: Create Test First (Should PASS)

**User request (Step 1)**: "Create `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.test.sh` with a failing assertion"

**Expected**: File created (test files always allowed)

**User request (Step 2)**: "Now create `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.sh`"

**Expected**: File created (test file exists from Step 1)

**Validation**: Both files created, proper TDD cycle

---

### Scenario 3: Create Both in Same Batch (Should PASS)

**User request**: "Create both `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.test.sh` with test AND `.cursor/scripts/test-blocking.sh` with implementation in this message"

**Expected**: Both files created (same batch detection)

**Validation**: Both files created together

---

### Scenario 4: Edit File With Tests (Should PASS)

**User request**: "Add a comment to `.cursor/scripts/rules-list.sh`"

**Expected**: Edit applied (rules-list.test.sh exists)

**Validation**: Edit successful

---

### Scenario 5: Edit File Without Tests (Should FAIL)

**User request**: "Edit a source file that doesn't have tests"

**Expected**: Gate blocks, requires test creation first

**Validation**: Edit blocked, error shown

---

## Monitoring Dashboard (End of Week)

### Summary Template

```markdown
## Blocking TDD Enforcement — Week 1 Results

**Period**: 2025-10-24 to 2025-10-31

**Metrics**:

- File operations tracked: ?
- TDD violations: ? (target: 0)
- Violations blocked: ? (should be same as violations attempted)
- False positives: ? (target: <1%)
- Gate accuracy: ?% (target: 100%)

**Test scenarios executed**:

- Scenario 1 (create without test): [PASS | FAIL]
- Scenario 2 (test first): [PASS | FAIL]
- Scenario 3 (both together): [PASS | FAIL]
- Scenario 4 (edit with test): [PASS | FAIL]
- Scenario 5 (edit without test): [PASS | FAIL]

**Issues found**:

- [List any gate failures or false positives]

**Adjustments made**:

- [Any exemption additions or fixes]

**Conclusion**: [Blocking enforcement working | needs adjustment]
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2 passes if**:

- ✅ At least 3/5 test scenarios executed
- ✅ Blocking behavior confirmed (Scenario 1 blocks correctly)
- ✅ No workflow disruption (Scenarios 2-4 pass correctly)
- ✅ Error messages clear and actionable

**Phase 3 passes if** (after 1 week):

- ✅ 0 TDD violations (≥20 file operations tracked)
- ✅ <1% false positives
- ✅ 100% gate trigger accuracy
- ✅ No user frustration or workflow issues

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 Start)

1. **User executes Scenario 1** (create source without test)
2. Observe: Does gate block message?
3. Document: Result in monitoring log

### Ongoing (Phase 3)

1. Track all file operations for 1 week
2. Document any violations or false positives
3. Collect metrics
4. Adjust exemptions if needed

### Completion (Phase 4)

1. Analyze week 1 results
2. Calculate metrics vs targets
3. Document findings
4. Mark project complete if successful

**Status**: Monitoring infrastructure ready  
**Next**: Execute Scenario 1 (user validation test)  
**Ready for**: User to test "Create test-blocking.sh without tests"
