## Usage Instructions

**When to update**:

- End of significant work sessions
- After major decisions or scope changes
- Before phase transitions
- During project completion/archival

**Categories**:

- **Added** — New features, approaches, artifacts
- **Changed** — Scope changes, refactors, approach pivots
- **Decisions** — Key decisions with rationale
- **Removed** — Deprecated approaches, out-of-scope items
- **Fixed** — Corrections to findings, protocols, or artifacts

**Tips**:

- Keep entries high-level (not every commit)
- Link to detailed session summaries or findings when relevant
- Focus on "what changed" and "why" (not implementation details)
- Use past tense for completed work

## [Completed] - 2025-10-28

### Summary

Project completed via early completion assessment (Option 3). Primary friction point (slash commands over-gating) resolved and validated. Comprehensive documentation (2,750+ lines) and test suite (33 scenarios) delivered. Remaining validation deferred to organic usage.

### Decisions

- **Early Completion (2025-10-28)**: Approved completion despite partial validation. Primary objective (slash commands) validated; remaining items observational/optional.
- **Deferred Validation**: Metrics collection and extended monitoring deferred to production usage (3-6 months).
- **Optional Scope Not Pursued**: Platform testing and portability classification deemed unnecessary for current needs.

## [Phase 3: Validation] - 2025-10-24 to 2025-10-28

### Summary

Initiated validation period; validated slash commands in real sessions (4/4 tests passed). Established monitoring framework. Concluded validation sufficient for completion.

### Added

- Real-session testing: validated `/commit`, `/pr`, `/branch`, `/allowlist` (4/4 passed, 2025-10-22)
- Monitoring structure: `monitoring/findings/` and `monitoring/logs/` directories
- Validation findings document: `validation-findings.md`

### Decisions

- **Validation Scope (2025-10-24)**: Primary focus on slash commands (highest impact); defer observational metrics.
- **Monitoring Period Shortened (2025-10-28)**: Concluded 4 days sufficient given slash command validation success.

## [Phase 2: Implementation] - 2025-10-11 to 2025-10-24

### Summary

Implemented all 5 consent mechanisms with comprehensive documentation. Updated 3 rule files. Created 33-scenario test suite. See `phase2-summary.md` for full details.

### Added

- **Core Fixes** (4 complete):
  - Slash command bypass (`.cursor/rules/assistant-behavior.mdc` lines 29-44)
  - `/allowlist` command and natural language triggers
  - Session allowlist grant/revoke syntax (lines 80-106)
  - Expanded safe read-only allowlist (lines 59-78)
- **Additional Refinements** (5 complete):

  - Risk tiers specification: `risk-tiers.md` (~600 lines)
  - Composite consent detection: `composite-consent-signals.md` (~450 lines)
  - Consent state tracking: `consent-state-tracking.md` (~550 lines)
  - Decision flowchart: `consent-decision-flowchart.md` (~500 lines)
  - Test suite: `consent-test-suite.md` (33 scenarios, ~650 lines)

- **Rules Updates**:
  - `assistant-behavior.mdc`: Slash bypass, allowlist, state tracking, composite consent
  - `user-intent.mdc`: Composite signals with confidence tiers
  - `intent-routing.mdc`: `/allowlist` command, natural language triggers

### Decisions

- **Test Suite Threshold (2025-10-24)**: 33 scenarios (220% of ≥15 requirement) deemed comprehensive.
- **State Tracking Addition (2025-10-23)**: Not initially scoped, but emerged as critical for reducing redundant prompts.

## [Phase 1: Analysis] - 2025-10-11 to 2025-10-22

### Summary

Analyzed consent gate failures, categorized operations by risk, identified exception mechanism gaps. Established baseline and priorities.

### Added

- Project structure: ERD, tasks, README
- Issue prioritization: 5 consent gate issues documented (slash commands #1)
- Risk tier categories: Tier 1 (safe), Tier 2 (moderate), Tier 3 (risky)
- Exception mechanism audit: 4 gaps identified

### Decisions

- **Prioritization (2025-10-11)**: Slash command over-gating identified as highest-impact friction point.
- **Risk-Based Approach (2025-10-11)**: Categorize operations by risk to balance UX and safety.
- **Optional Scope Defined (2025-10-11)**: Platform testing and portability marked as "if in scope" (not blocking).
