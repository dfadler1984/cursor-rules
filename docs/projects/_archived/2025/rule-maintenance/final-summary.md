# Final Summary

## Outcome

- Rule maintenance hardened: validator supports JSON output, missing references checks, autofix, staleness checks, and review reports; CI added on PRs.

## What Worked

- Small, focused flags with matching tests enabled incremental rollout.
- Clear Review Flow in the ERD; tasks tracked end-to-end work.

## Improvements

- Consider a `--strict` umbrella flag to enable all failure modes.
- Optional: publish the review report as a PR comment for visibility.
