# Final Summary — Shellcheck

## Summary

Integrated ShellCheck linting across all shell scripts achieving zero errors and zero warnings. Created shellcheck-run.sh with graceful degradation (D5 portability). Added `.shellcheckrc` at repo root for centralized suppressions with documented rationale. Migrated 40+ trap statements to trap_cleanup helper. Enabled CI enforcement (blocking on failures). All 104 scripts now pass ShellCheck validation.

## Impact

- **Errors eliminated**: 2 → 0 (parser and syntax issues resolved)
- **Warnings eliminated**: 55 → 0 (fixed or suppressed with rationale)
- **Scripts linted**: 85 → 104 (increased coverage)
- **CI enforcement**: Optional → Blocking (prevents regressions)
- **Code quality**: trap_cleanup helper eliminated 40+ redundant trap statements

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Centralized `.shellcheckrc` configuration at repo root
- trap_cleanup helper pattern simplified test code
- Phased approach (errors first, then warnings, then CI)
- All suppressions documented with clear rationale

### What to improve

- Initial plan for separate `.shellcheckrc` per script was unnecessary (inline worked well initially)
- Centralized config was better final state

### Follow-ups

- None; ShellCheck integration complete and enforced in CI
