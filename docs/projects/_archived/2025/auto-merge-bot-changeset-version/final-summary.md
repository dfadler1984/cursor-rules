# Final Summary — Auto‑merge Changesets Version PRs

## Outcome

- Auto‑merge (squash) is enabled automatically on Changesets “Version Packages” PRs once required checks pass.

## What Worked

- Dedicated workflow `.github/workflows/changesets-auto-merge.yml` with `workflow_run` and manual dispatch.
- Environment‑scoped PAT `AUTO_MERGE_TOKEN` exposed as `GH_TOKEN` for `enable-pull-request-automerge@v3`.
- Manual backfill via dispatch and helper `.cursor/scripts/changesets-automerge-dispatch.sh`.

## Improvements

- Consider a token preflight (curl `/user`) to fail fast on bad credentials/SSO.
