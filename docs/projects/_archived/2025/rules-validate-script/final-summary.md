# Final Summary — Rules Validate Script

## Outcome

Add a repository-local validator (.cursor/scripts/rules-validate.sh) that scans .cursor/rules/*.mdc for common correctness and consistency issues. The goal is to automate detection of front matter problems, CSV/boolean format violations, deprecated references, and specific typos or regressions found during recent maintenance.

## Impact (Metrics)

- Baseline → After: rules validator exits 0 on current rules set
- Quality/Reliability: CI gating via non-zero exit on violations
- Developer Experience: Automated checks and clearer diagnostics for maintainers

## Retrospective

- What worked: POSIX-only approach; focused checks; CI gating
- What to improve: add timing metric; reduce link-check noise; harden lifecycle validator
- Follow-ups (owners, dates): add Completed index; fix lifecycle validator; add timing flag
