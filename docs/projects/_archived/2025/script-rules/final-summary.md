# Final Summary â€” Script Rules

## Summary

Defined best practices and validation requirements for shell scripts. Work was consolidated into specialized validators (help-validate.sh, error-validate.sh) rather than creating a monolithic script-rules-validate.sh. Standards integrated into D1-D3 cross-cutting decisions. All validation requirements embedded in focused, single-purpose validators that can be run independently or composed.

## Impact

- **Validation coverage**: 47 scripts validated via specialized validators
- **Standards**: Embedded in D1 (help), D2 (strict mode), D3 (exit codes)
- **Validators**: 2 focused scripts (help-validate, error-validate) vs 1 monolithic
- **Compliance**: 100% across all dimensions

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Specialized validators more maintainable than monolithic approach
- Each validator has focused responsibility (Unix Philosophy)
- Integration with D1-D3 standards provided clear requirements

### What to improve

- Original plan assumed monolithic validator; pivoted to focused approach (good outcome)

### Follow-ups

- None; validators maintained in repository
