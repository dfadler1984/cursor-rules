# Final Summary â€” Skip Changeset Opt-In

## Outcome

- Made `skip-changeset` labeling opt-in via `--docs-only` alias and generic `--label` flags in `.cursor/scripts/pr-create.sh`.

## What Worked

- Dry-run labels output enabled testable behavior without network calls.
- Post-create labeling via Issues API isolated side effects after successful PR creation.

## Improvements

- Consider an additional convenience flag for common repo labels if patterns emerge.
