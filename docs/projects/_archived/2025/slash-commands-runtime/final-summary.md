# Final Summary — Slash Commands Runtime

## Summary

Implemented runtime execution semantics for slash commands (`/plan`, `/tasks`, `/pr`) beyond documentation, enabling trigger-based workflows with proper consent gates and state management. Delivered comprehensive behavioral specifications for command parsing, execution, error handling, and integration with existing rules. All 8 tasks completed including optional enhancements (aliases, workflow state tracking), resulting in an immediately usable slash command system requiring no repository code changes.

## Impact

- **Baseline → Outcome**: Slash commands — Documentation-only → Fully specified runtime execution semantics
- **Command coverage**: 0 executable commands → 3 commands with full specifications (`/plan`, `/tasks`, `/pr`)
- **Behavioral specifications**: 8 detailed specs created (parser, 3 commands, error handling, integration, testing, optionals)
- **Optional enhancements**: 2/3 completed (aliases ✅, workflow state tracking ✅, auto-completion documented as infeasible)
- **Notes**: Pure behavioral specification project; no code implementation needed. Specifications enable immediate assistant use. Paired with productivity project for consistent automation philosophy.

## Retrospective

### What worked

- **Specification-first approach**: Defining behavior before "implementation" created clear acceptance criteria and natural test scenarios
- **Comprehensive error handling upfront**: Documented all failure modes before building commands, resulting in consistent error patterns
- **Sequential pairing with productivity project**: Established automation patterns first, then applied to slash commands
- **Optional enhancements evaluation**: Assessing feasibility and documenting alternatives (auto-completion) provided clear scope boundaries

### What to improve

- **Template completion**: final-summary.md template was created but not filled during archival workflow (discovered during audit)
- **README.md missing**: Standard project navigation file not created before archival

### Follow-ups

- **Validation in practice**: Use commands in real workflows to collect feedback and refine error messages
- **Monitor adoption**: Track usage patterns to identify pain points and adjust help text
- **Consider future enhancements** (if validated): Session state for smarter suggestions, batch operations
