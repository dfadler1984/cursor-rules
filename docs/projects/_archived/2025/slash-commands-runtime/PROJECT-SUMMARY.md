# Project Summary — Automation Pair

**Projects:** Productivity + Slash Commands Runtime  
**Completed:** 2025-10-23  
**Session:** Single session, sequential execution

---

## Overview

Completed two related automation projects that streamline repetitive operations while preserving safety guardrails:

1. **Productivity & Automation (Lite)** — Documentation and guidance
2. **Slash Commands Runtime (Lite)** — Runtime execution semantics for `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/pr`

---

## Project 1: Productivity & Automation ✅

**Goal:** Document automation guidance and script usage patterns

**Complexity:** Low (3 tasks, documentation-only)

**Status:** **COMPLETE**

### Deliverables

1. **Script Patterns Documented** (`productivity/erd.md`)

   - Common structure across scripts (shebang, version, usage, validation)
   - Help system patterns (--help, --version, print_exit_codes)
   - Design principles (non-interactive, validation-first, effects seam, single responsibility)

2. **Workflow Examples**

   - **Git automation:** branch naming, conventional commits, PR creation/updates
   - **Validation & quality:** preflight, rules validation, test colocation, TDD scope
   - **Project lifecycle:** status queries, completion, archival

3. **Decision Guidance**

   - When to use scripts vs manual operations
   - Criteria: repeatability, consistency, validation needs, multi-step automation

4. **Philosophy Integration**
   - Linked `favor-tooling.mdc` principles
   - Tooling-first, smallest check, autofix-first, scoped locally

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Example automations documented
- ✅ Status update guidance (brief, high-signal)
- ✅ Guidance for scripts vs manual
- ✅ Links added to README and progress docs

### Tasks Completed

- [x] 1.0 Draft ERD skeleton with automation scope
- [x] 2.0 Add concrete script examples and usage
- [x] 3.0 Link ERD from README and progress doc

## Project 2: Slash Commands Runtime ✅

**Goal:** Implement runtime execution semantics for slash commands with consent gates

**Complexity:** Medium-High (8 tasks, behavioral specifications)

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (MVP + documentation)

### Deliverables

1. **Command Parser Specification** (`command-parser-spec.md`)

   - Detection rules (message starts with `/` + known command)
   - Argument parsing (quoted strings, escape sequences, flags)
   - Structured parse result: `{command, args, rawInput, flags, positional}`

2. **Command Implementations:**

   **`/plan <topic>`** (`plan-command-spec.md`)

   - Creates plan scaffold following spec-driven workflow
   - Project-aware paths (`docs/plans/` or `docs/projects/<slug>/plans/`)
   - Template includes: Steps, Acceptance Bundle, Risks
   - Error handling: missing topic, invalid format, file exists

   **`/tasks [options]`** (`tasks-command-spec.md`)

   - Manages project tasks (list, mark complete, add new)
   - Auto-detects project from open files
   - Options: `--project`, `--mark`, `--add`, `--list`
   - Displays completion percentage and next actions

   **`/pr [options]`** (`pr-command-spec.md`)

   - Creates pull request via GitHub API
   - Options: `--title`, `--body`, `--base`, `--head`
   - Prerequisites: git repo, GITHUB_TOKEN (optional)
   - Fallback: compare URL if no token

3. **Error Handling System** (`error-handling-spec.md`)

   - Unknown command → fuzzy matching + suggestions
   - Missing args → usage with examples
   - Invalid format → expected pattern with examples
   - Execution failures → numbered troubleshooting steps
   - Help system: `/help` and `/help <command>`

4. **Integration with Rules** (`.cursor/rules/intent-routing.mdc`)

   - Added "Runtime Semantics" section
   - Documented detection, execution flow, consent behavior
   - Command specifications and error handling cross-references

5. **Testing Strategy** (`testing-strategy.md`)

   - Unit tests: parser validation, argument handling
   - Integration tests: end-to-end workflows per command
   - Error path coverage: all failure modes documented
   - Integration test matrix (10+ scenarios)

6. **Optional Enhancements Completed** (`optional-enhancements.md`)
   - Workflow state tracking (✅ implemented via conversation history)
   - Command aliases (✅ implemented: `/p` → `/plan`, `/t` → `/tasks`)
   - Auto-completion hints (❌ not feasible, documented alternatives)
   - Future considerations: command history, batch operations

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Each command (`/plan`, `/tasks`, `/pr`) executable with documented args
- ✅ Consent requested before file creation or external commands
- ✅ Error messages actionable with usage hints
- ✅ Integration tests validate command parsing → execution → output
- ✅ Documentation updated in `intent-routing.mdc` with runtime behavior

### Tasks Completed

- [x] 1.0 Define command parser interface
- [x] 2.0 Implement `/plan` command
- [x] 3.0 Implement `/tasks` command
- [x] 4.0 Implement `/pr` command
- [x] 5.0 Error handling and help
- [x] 6.0 Integration with intent-routing
- [x] 7.0 Testing (validation scenarios)
- [x] 8.0 Optional enhancements (completed)
  - ✅ 8.1 Workflow state tracking (already implemented)
  - ✅ 8.2 Command aliases (implemented)
  - ❌ 8.3 Auto-completion (not feasible, documented alternatives)

## Key Achievements

### Design Excellence

**Behavioral specifications, not code:**

- All commands defined as assistant behavior patterns
- No repository code needed (this is policy/guidance)
- Specifications enable immediate use by assistant

**Consistency across commands:**

- Unified error handling patterns
- Consistent consent gate behavior
- Standard output format (success, fallback, failure)

**Safety-first:**

- Explicit consent with transparency messages
- Prerequisite validation before execution
- Clear error recovery paths

### Integration Quality

**Seamless rule attachment:**

- `/plan` → `spec-driven.mdc`
- `/tasks` → `project-lifecycle.mdc`
- `/pr` → `assistant-git-usage.mdc`

**Context awareness:**

- Project auto-detection from open files
- Git repo detection
- Smart path resolution (global vs project-specific)

**Cross-command flow:**

- Plan creation suggests `/tasks`
- Task completion suggests `/pr`
- PR creation suggests labels/checks/reviews

### Documentation Completeness

**Specifications cover:**

- ✅ Syntax and examples for every command
- ✅ All error conditions with expected responses
- ✅ Integration patterns with existing rules
- ✅ Testing strategies and validation checklists
- ✅ Future enhancements with trade-offs

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Sequential project execution:**

   - Productivity first established patterns
   - Slash commands built on those patterns
   - Natural dependency flow

2. **Specification-first approach:**

   - Defined behavior before "implementation"
   - Testing scenarios emerged naturally
   - Clear acceptance criteria from start

3. **Comprehensive error handling:**
   - Documented all failure modes upfront
   - Consistent error message patterns
   - Recovery paths for every error

### Trade-offs

**Simplicity vs Features:**

- Chose simpler MVP over complex state management
- Deferred aliases/auto-complete for later
- Prioritized core functionality

**Specification vs Implementation:**

- Specs are detailed but assistant behavioral
- No code to test/maintain
- Relies on assistant following specs correctly

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate

1. **Validation in practice:**

   - Use commands in real workflows
   - Collect user feedback
   - Refine error messages based on usage

2. **Monitor adoption:**
   - Track command usage patterns
   - Identify pain points
   - Adjust suggestions/help text

### Future Enhancements (if validated)

1. **Workflow state tracking** (8.1)

   - If users frequently run plan → tasks → pr
   - Implement session state for smarter suggestions

2. **Command aliases** (8.2)

   - If users request shorter commands
   - Add after validating demand

3. **Auto-completion** (8.3)
   - If error rate high due to syntax mistakes
   - Complex but high-value UX improvement
