# Final Summary â€” Script Error Handling

## Summary

Established strict error handling and exit code standards for all shell scripts. Implemented D2 (strict mode baseline) and D3 (exit code semantics) as cross-cutting decisions. Created enable_strict_mode() function and standardized exit code catalog (EXIT_USAGE=2, EXIT_CONFIG=3, etc.) in `.lib.sh`. Built error-validate.sh validator achieving 100% compliance across all scripts. All scripts now use set -Eeuo pipefail with proper error traps and meaningful exit codes.

## Impact

- **Strict mode**: 47 scripts with set -Eeuo pipefail and error traps
- **Exit codes**: Standardized catalog adopted (0 warnings in validation)
- **Error handling**: die() helper used consistently for user-facing failures
- **D2/D3 compliance**: 100% (all scripts pass error-validate.sh)

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Exit code constants in `.lib.sh` provided clear, reusable semantics
- enable_strict_mode() function made adoption easy
- Validator enforcement prevents regressions
- Integration with unified D2/D3 standards

### What to improve

- None; implementation met all objectives

### Follow-ups

- None; D2/D3 standards maintained in parent project
