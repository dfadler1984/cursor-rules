# Final Summary — Shell Scripts

## Summary

Created a cohesive suite of 8 shell scripts to replace Node/yarn-based helpers with portable, documented CLI tooling for macOS/bash. All scripts follow standardized patterns: strict modes, `--help`/`--version` flags, clear logging, non-zero exit codes on failure, and comprehensive test coverage. The suite includes rules metadata (list/validate), Git helpers (commit/branch-name), PR creation, security scanning, workflow linting, and preflight checks. All scripts are now deployed under `.cursor/scripts/` with colocated tests.

## Impact

- Baseline → Outcome: Script count — 0 → 8 (rules-list, rules-validate, git-commit, git-branch-name, pr-create, security-scan, lint-workflows, preflight)
- Test coverage — 0% → 100% (each script has `.test.sh` with success/failure/edge cases)
- Dependency footprint — Node/yarn required → optional jq/actionlint with graceful degradation
- Help consistency — mixed/missing → standardized `-h|--help` and `--version` across all scripts
- Notes: Portable, fast, and well-documented; forms the foundation for shell-and-script-tooling unified coordination

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Strict mode baseline (`set -euo pipefail`, safe `IFS`) prevented common shell pitfalls
- Colocated tests (`.test.sh` next to implementation) improved discoverability and maintainability
- Lightweight bash runner (`.cursor/scripts/tests/run.sh`) avoided heavy test framework dependencies
- JSON/table dual output modes (rules-list) provided flexibility for both human and machine consumption
- Graceful degradation for optional deps (jq, actionlint) kept scripts usable in minimal environments

### What to improve

- Help generation could be centralized via `.cursor/scripts/.lib.sh` helpers (see script-help-generation project)
- Exit code semantics not yet fully standardized across all scripts (see script-error-handling project)
- Network effects seam not yet applied (see networkless-scripts project for `.lib-net.sh` adoption)

### Follow-ups

- Unified coordination: [shell-and-script-tooling](../shell-and-script-tooling/erd.md) tracks cross-cutting decisions (D1-D4: Help/Version, Strict Mode, Error Semantics, Networkless)
- Adoption status for this project recorded in unified coordination tasks
