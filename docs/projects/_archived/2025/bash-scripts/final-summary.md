# Final Summary â€” Bash Scripts

## Summary

Established baseline shell script standards for the repository. Defined shebang conventions, strict mode requirements, and safety patterns. Work was embedded into unified D1-D6 standards in shell-and-script-tooling rather than maintained separately. All scripts now demonstrate standardized patterns via help template functions and strict error handling.

## Impact

- **Standards adoption**: All 45 production scripts follow shebang and strict mode conventions
- **Documentation**: Patterns documented in shell-and-script-tooling/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md
- **Integration**: Standards embedded in D1 (Help), D2 (Strict Mode), D3 (Exit Codes)

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Embedding standards in cross-cutting decisions (D1-D6) instead of separate documentation
- Template functions approach provided consistency without duplication
- Integration with unified project reduced fragmentation

### What to improve

- Could have started with unified approach rather than creating separate project
- No separate deliverables needed; all work absorbed by parent

### Follow-ups

- None; all standards maintained in shell-and-script-tooling (now archived)
