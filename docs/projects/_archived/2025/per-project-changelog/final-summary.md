# Per-Project Changelog — Final Summary

**Project**: per-project-changelog  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Completed**: 2025-10-28  
**Owner**: rules-maintainers

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive per-project changelog system with automatic generation capabilities, enabling projects to track evolution, decisions, and milestones in structured format.

## Impact

**Before**:

- No per-project change tracking
- Project history scattered across sessions, commits, tasks
- Difficult to understand "what changed" when returning to projects

**After**:

- ✅ Template for consistent changelog format
- ✅ Automatic generation from tasks.md (detects phases, tasks, decisions)
- ✅ Intelligent categorization (keyword-based: Create→Added, Update→Changed, Fix→Fixed)
- ✅ Three modes: dry-run (preview), interactive (review), auto (append)
- ✅ Integration with project creation (`--with-changelog` flag)
- ✅ Integration with archival workflow (final entry prompt)
- ✅ Validation for complex projects (warns if >15 files without changelog)

**Metrics** (Updated with Phase 5):

- 3 scripts created:
  - `changelog-update.sh` (409 lines) — Main automation
  - `changelog-backfill.sh` (138 lines) — Archived project support
  - `changelog-diff.sh` (97 lines) — Milestone comparison
- 6 test suites updated/created (all passing):
  - `changelog-update.test.sh` (11 tests, new)
  - `changelog-backfill.test.sh` (3 tests, new)
  - `changelog-diff.test.sh` (3 tests, new)
  - `project-create.test.sh` (+2 tests for --with-changelog)
  - `project-archive-workflow.test.sh` (+1 test for changelog detection)
  - `validate-project-lifecycle.test.sh` (+1 test for CHANGELOG advisory)
- 1 GitHub Action workflow (`changelog-phase-reminder.yml`)
- 1 template (`.cursor/templates/project-lifecycle/CHANGELOG.template.md`)
- 3 scripts updated (`project-create.sh`, `project-archive-workflow.sh`, `validate-project-lifecycle.sh`)
- 3 rule files updated (`project-lifecycle.mdc`, `capabilities.mdc`, `scope-check.mdc`)
- 8 examples/backfills:
  - 3 archived: shell-and-script-tooling, slash-commands-runtime, routing-optimization
  - 4 active: rules-enforcement-investigation, multi-chat-coordination, archived-projects-audit, consent-gates-refinement
  - 1 dogfooding: per-project-changelog itself

## Deliverables

### Core Artifacts

1. **Template**: `.cursor/templates/project-lifecycle/CHANGELOG.template.md`

   - Keep-a-Changelog inspired format
   - Project-specific categories
   - Usage instructions included

2. **Script**: `.cursor/scripts/changelog-update.sh`

   - Pattern detection (phases, tasks, decisions, scope changes)
   - Intelligent categorization (keyword matching)
   - Three modes (dry-run, interactive, auto)
   - File insertion with backup
   - 11 passing tests

3. **Documentation**:

   - `project-lifecycle.mdc` — Per-Project Changelog section with format, usage, integration
   - `capabilities.mdc` — Script documented in Project Status & Coordination
   - `docs/projects/README.md` — Guidance section with examples

4. **Examples**:
   - `rules-enforcement-investigation/CHANGELOG.md` — Complex project with 7 phases
   - `per-project-changelog/CHANGELOG.md` — This project (dogfooding)

### Automation Features

**Pattern Detection**:

- ✅ Completed phases from tasks.md headers
- ✅ Completed parent tasks (X.0 format)
- ✅ Decision markers (D1:, D2:, Decision:)
- ✅ Scope changes (Migrated, Superseded, Deferred)
- ⏳ Git log parsing (structure ready, not critical for MVP)
- ⏳ ERD status changes (deferred, not needed)

**Categorization**:

- ✅ Create, Add, Implement → Added
- ✅ Update, Modify, Refactor → Changed
- ✅ Fix, Correct, Resolve → Fixed
- ✅ Remove, Delete, Deprecate → Removed
- ✅ Decision markers → Decisions

**Modes**:

- ✅ Dry-run: Preview without modification
- ✅ Interactive: Review and confirm before append
- ✅ Auto: Append without prompts

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (All Complete)

- [x] Template for per-project `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] Documentation in `project-lifecycle.mdc`
- [x] Example in active investigation project
- [x] Integration with archival workflow

### Should Have (All Complete)

- [x] Script to stub changelog from project creation
- [x] Validation for completed projects
- [x] Automatic generation script with pattern detection

### Nice to Have (Deferred to Future)

- [ ] Link project changelogs to root `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] GitHub Action to auto-detect phase completion

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **TDD approach**: Tests caught issues early (grep patterns, command substitution with set -e)
2. **Pattern analysis first**: Reviewing archived projects identified concrete, detectable patterns
3. **Incremental implementation**: Script structure → parsers → formatters → modes
4. **Dogfooding**: Using the changelog for this project validated the format and workflow

### Challenges

1. **Scope assumption**: Initially assumed manual-only was acceptable (Lite mode) without asking user

   - **Fix**: Updated `scope-check.mdc` with "Never assume priority" rule
   - **Lesson**: Always present options and ask explicitly about automation vs manual

2. **TDD violation**: Created implementation script without test file first

   - **Fix**: Created test file immediately when caught
   - **Lesson**: Pre-edit gate applies to shell scripts too

3. **Regex complexity**: Phase name cleanup required multiple attempts
   - **Fix**: Simplified to strip everything after time estimate
   - **Lesson**: Start with simple patterns, refine based on real data

### Improvements Applied

1. **Rule Update**: Added "Priority/Scope Decisions (Never Assume)" section to `scope-check.mdc`
   - Prevents future assumptions about Must Have vs Nice to Have
   - Requires explicit user input on priorities
   - Pattern: "Is X required, or is Y acceptable?"

## Related Work

- [Rules Enforcement Investigation](./rules-enforcement-investigation/) — Example project with rich changelog
- [Project Lifecycle](./project-lifecycle/) — Integration point

## Future Enhancements

Deferred to future work or other projects:

- Backfill changelogs for archived projects
- Link project changelogs to root CHANGELOG for cross-reference
- GitHub Action integration for phase completion detection
- Enhanced git log parsing (map commit types to categories)
- ERD status change detection
- Summary auto-generation from phase tasks

## Retrospective

### What Went Well

1. **Pattern analysis approach**: Reviewing archived projects first identified concrete, actionable patterns
2. **TDD discipline**: Tests caught issues early and provided confidence
3. **Incremental delivery**: Manual system (Phases 1-3) provided immediate value before automation
4. **Dogfooding**: Using the changelog for this project validated format and workflow
5. **User correction on priorities**: Caught scope assumption early, updated rules to prevent future occurrences
6. **Carryover execution**: All 4 enhancements delivered in Phase 5, expanding system capabilities significantly

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial scoping**: Should have asked "manual or automatic?" explicitly before assuming Lite mode
   - Mitigation: Added "Never assume priority" guidance to `scope-check.mdc`
2. **TDD violations**:
   - Created `changelog-update.sh` before `changelog-update.test.sh`
   - Modified 3 existing scripts without adding tests first
   - Mitigation: Tests added for all changes (4 test suites, all passing)
3. **Regex complexity**: Phase name parsing took multiple iterations
   - Mitigation: Started simple, refined based on real data

### Carryovers

_None — all core functionality delivered_

Future optional enhancements listed above can be addressed in follow-up projects if needed.

**Outcome**: Simple, automatic changelog system ready for immediate use across all projects.  
**Total Effort**: ~14 hours (6 hours manual baseline + 8 hours automation)  
**Status**: COMPLETE — All phases delivered, tests passing, documentation complete
