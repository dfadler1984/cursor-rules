## Tasks — ERD: Core Values Enhancement

## Relevant Files

- `docs/projects/core-values/erd.md`
- `.cursor/rules/00-assistant-laws.mdc` (target for enhancements)
- `README.md` (main repo README, needs link)

## Carryovers

- [x] 1.0 Draft ERD skeleton with guardrails and behaviors (original scope)
- [x] 1.1 Pivot ERD to focus on practical scenarios (scope refined after discovering laws already implemented)

## Todo

- [x] 2.0 Add practical scenarios to `00-assistant-laws.mdc`
  - [x] 2.1 Scenario 1 (First Law): Low confidence → qualification + reversible step
  - [x] 2.2 Scenario 2 (Third Law): User correction → 4-step acknowledgment
  - [x] 2.3 Scenario 3 (First Law): Conflicting sources → reconciliation before advising
  - [x] 2.4 Scenario 4 (First Law): Gaming/evasion → surface constraint instead
  - [x] 2.5 Scenario 5 (Second Law): Guidance change → explicit acknowledgment
- [x] 3.0 Update metadata and links
  - [x] 3.1 Update `lastReviewed` date in `00-assistant-laws.mdc` front matter (2025-10-23)
  - [x] 3.2 Add link from main `README.md` to `00-assistant-laws.mdc`
  - [x] 3.3 Update split-progress tracker status
