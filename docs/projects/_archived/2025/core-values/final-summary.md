# Final Summary — Core Values

## Summary

Enhanced the three assistant laws (Truth/Accuracy, Consistency/Transparency, Self-Correction/Accountability) documented in `.cursor/rules/00-assistant-laws.mdc` by adding 5 concrete scenarios demonstrating practical application. The project scope was refined after discovering the laws were already fully implemented—the gap was lack of practical examples showing abstract principles in action. Deliverables: scenarios added to laws file, prominent link from main README, project archived with all tasks complete.

## Impact

- Baseline → Outcome: Usability — Abstract behavioral requirements only → Abstract requirements + 5 concrete dialogue examples
- File length: 50 lines → 76 lines (well under 150-line budget)
- Notes: Each scenario demonstrates a specific law in 3-5 lines using clear before/after or dialogue format. Examples include low-confidence qualification, conflicting source reconciliation, gaming/evasion prevention, guidance change acknowledgment, and 4-step user correction protocol.

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Early scope pivot after discovering laws already implemented saved effort
- Constraint-driven design (scenarios ≤5 lines, file <150 lines) kept deliverables focused
- Clear acceptance criteria made completion unambiguous
- Using ERD lite mode was appropriate for the enhancement scope

### What to improve

- Initial ERD assumed laws needed creation rather than checking implementation first
- Could have validated current state before drafting project scope

### Follow-ups

- None required; laws are complete with examples and prominently linked from README
