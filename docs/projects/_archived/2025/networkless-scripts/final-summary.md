# Final Summary â€” Networkless Scripts

## Summary

Established networkless testing standard (D4) with effects seams and fixtures. Created `.lib-net.sh` with test helpers (net_fixture, net_request) and fixtures directory structure. Migrated 4 GitHub API scripts to use seams for testability while allowing production network calls. Tests now use fixtures and never make live API calls. Built network-guard.sh validator (informational mode) tracking legitimate network usage. Final decision: 7 scripts legitimately use network for their primary purpose; all tests isolated with fixtures.

## Impact

- **Test isolation**: 56 tests use fixtures/seams, 0 make live network calls
- **Network usage**: 7 scripts documented as legitimate (GitHub automation, setup)
- **Infrastructure**: `.lib-net.sh` library with fixture helpers
- **Fixtures**: Comprehensive GitHub API fixtures for deterministic testing
- **Validator**: network-guard.sh tracks network usage (informational)

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Effects seam pattern (CURL_CMD=, JQ_CMD=) enabled test injection
- Fixture-based testing provides deterministic, fast tests
- Informational validator tracks without blocking legitimate network use
- D4 standard clear about when network is appropriate

### What to improve

- Initial guidance-based approach for GitHub scripts was considered but seam approach was better

### Follow-ups

- None; D4 standard enforced via test patterns
