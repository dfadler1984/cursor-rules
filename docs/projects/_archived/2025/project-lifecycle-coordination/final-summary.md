# Final Summary — Project Lifecycle Coordination

## Summary

Created automated project lifecycle management tooling to coordinate project state transitions from creation through completion and archival. Delivered three new scripts (`project-create.sh`, `project-status.sh`, `project-complete.sh`) with comprehensive TDD coverage (25+ passing tests), implementation plan with design decisions, and updated capabilities documentation. All lifecycle transitions now automated with clear validation gates and user guidance.

## Impact

- Baseline → Outcome: Manual project lifecycle coordination → Fully automated tooling-driven workflow
- Scripts created: 3 production scripts + 3 test suites
- Test coverage: 25+ behavior-driven tests (10 for create, 8 for status, 7 for complete)
- Workflow validation: Full end-to-end lifecycle tested (create → status → complete → archive)
- Documentation: Implementation plan, resolved open questions (5 design decisions), updated capabilities.mdc

## Retrospective

### What worked

- TDD-first approach ensured script reliability from the start
- Implementation plan with design decisions resolved ambiguities upfront
- Template-based project creation (Full/Lite modes) provides flexibility
- Status detection with next-action suggestions guides users effectively
- Soft gates with --force override balances strictness with pragmatism

### What to improve

- Zero-tasks edge case required post-implementation fix (grep -c behavior)
- Could add more sophisticated validation integration (currently basic checks)
- Assistant rule integration deferred to capabilities.mdc (could create dedicated rule later)

### Follow-ups

- Monitor usage patterns to identify additional automation opportunities
- Consider adding `project-pause.sh` and `project-resume.sh` for state management
- May need dedicated `project-lifecycle.mdc` rule if behavioral guidance becomes necessary (currently capabilities.mdc sufficient)
