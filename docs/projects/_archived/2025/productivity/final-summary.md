# Final Summary — Productivity & Automation

## Summary

Documented automation guidance and script usage patterns for the repository's 15+ automation scripts. Established clear decision criteria for when to use scripts vs manual operations, categorized workflows (Git, validation, project lifecycle), and integrated with the favor-tooling philosophy. All three tasks completed in a single focused session, delivering comprehensive examples and actionable guidance.

## Impact

- **Baseline → Outcome:** Documentation coverage — 0 automation examples → 15+ scripts documented with patterns
- **Workflow clarity:** Undefined → 3 clear categories (Git automation, validation/quality, project lifecycle)
- **Decision support:** Ad-hoc → Clear criteria for scripts vs manual operations
- **Notes:** Low-risk documentation project that provides immediate value for users learning repository automation. All acceptance criteria met.

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Sequential execution with slash-commands-runtime created natural dependency flow
- Pattern extraction from real scripts provided concrete, actionable examples
- Integration with existing favor-tooling.mdc avoided duplication
- Clear categorization (Git, validation, lifecycle) made guidance scannable

### What to improve

- Could add more examples of when NOT to automate (edge cases where manual is better)
- Future: Consider adding workflow diagrams for complex multi-script operations

### Follow-ups

- Monitor actual script usage to validate documented patterns match reality
- Consider creating quick-reference guide if users request it
- Link from main README if automation guidance needs higher visibility
