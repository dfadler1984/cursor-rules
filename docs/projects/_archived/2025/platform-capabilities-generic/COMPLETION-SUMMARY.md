# Completion Summary — Platform Capabilities Generic

**Completed:** 2025-10-23  
**Project:** platform-capabilities-generic  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Paired with:** capabilities-rules

## Summary

Successfully generalized the Cursor-specific `cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc` rule into a vendor-agnostic `platform-capabilities.mdc` that can be used for any product or platform.

## Deliverables

1. **New Generic Rule:** `.cursor/rules/platform-capabilities.mdc`

   - Vendor-agnostic guidance for citing official docs
   - Applies to any product/platform (Cursor, GitHub, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Includes examples for good/bad citations, uncertainty handling, conflict resolution
   - `alwaysApply: false` (attach via intent routing)

2. **Deprecated Cursor-Specific Rule:** `.cursor/rules/cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc`

   - Now a pointer to the generic rule
   - Retains Cursor-specific doc links for convenience
   - Changed from `alwaysApply: true` to `false`

3. **Updated References**
   - `capabilities.mdc` → platform reference now points to generic rule

## Validation Results

✅ All validation checks passed:

- Front matter: OK (59 files)
- Format: OK (59 files)
- References: OK (59 files)
- Staleness: OK (59 files, threshold: 90d)
