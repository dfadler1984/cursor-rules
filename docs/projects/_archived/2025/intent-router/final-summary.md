# Final Summary — Intent Router

## Summary

Established a central intent routing system that parses user inputs and routes to appropriate rules with consent-first gates and TDD enforcement. All actionable routing triggers, parsing logic, clarify-on-ambiguity policies, and integration points were documented and implemented in `.cursor/rules/intent-routing.mdc`. Blocked items requiring automated enforcement and slash-command runtime handling were spun off into dedicated follow-up projects.

## Impact

- Baseline → Outcome: Intent classification — manual interpretation → automated routing with documented triggers
- Rule attachment — ad-hoc → systematic with confidence tiers and fuzzy matching
- TDD enforcement — inconsistent → hard-gated for JS/TS edits with owner spec requirements
- Notes: Reduced ambiguity in rule selection; established handoff contract for downstream rules; enabled progressive attachment strategy

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Explicit phrase triggers (e.g., `DRY RUN:`) provided high-confidence routing
- Composite consent-after-plan pattern captured implicit implementation intent effectively
- Clarify-on-ambiguity policy with confidence tiers (high/medium/low) balanced automation with safety
- Handoff contract (`{intent, targets, rule, gates, consentState}`) created clear integration points
- Slash commands mapping documented for `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/pr`

### What to improve

- Automated enforcement for role–phase mapping requires completion of dependent projects
- Fuzzy matching confirmation prompts could be more concise
- File/context signals as supporting triggers need clearer precedence rules

### Follow-ups

- [slash-commands-runtime](../../slash-commands-runtime/erd.md) — Runtime execution semantics for slash commands
- Automated enforcement blocked on: [role-phase-mapping](../../../role-phase-mapping/erd.md), [split-progress](../../../split-progress/erd.md)
