# Final Summary — Scripts Unix Philosophy

## Summary

Refactored repository scripts to embody Unix Philosophy principles: simple programs doing one thing well, composed via text streams. Created 10 focused single-responsibility alternatives extracted from 4 monolithic scripts. Converted 3 major scripts to orchestrators (rules-validate, context-efficiency-gauge, pr-create), reducing 839 lines while maintaining backward compatibility. Established enforcement rule (shell-unix-philosophy.mdc) to prevent future violations. All extraction work followed TDD with comprehensive test coverage.

## Impact

- **Line reduction**: 839 lines via orchestrators (rules-validate: 497→301, context-efficiency-gauge: 342→124)
- **Focused scripts**: 10 single-responsibility alternatives created (avg 165 lines vs 280+ in originals)
- **Test coverage**: 53 new tests created for extracted scripts, all passing
- **Enforcement**: Active rule prevents scripts >200 lines without justification
- **Composability**: All new scripts follow stdout/stderr separation, pipe-friendly

## Retrospective

### What worked

- TDD-first extraction ensured quality (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Orchestrator pattern successfully maintained backward compatibility
- Enforcement rule provides ongoing compliance without manual review
- D1-D6 infrastructure enabled focused, composable scripts

### What to improve

- Initial "completion" claims overstated progress (infrastructure vs actual refactoring)
- Extraction created new large script (rules-validate-format.sh at 226 lines)
- Could have updated originals to orchestrators in same session as extraction

### Follow-ups

- **script-refinement** (P3): Optional polish work
  - Extract checks-status.sh (Task 1.0)
  - Split rules-validate-format.sh (Task 2.0)
