# Final Summary — Capabilities Rules

## Summary

Evaluated and improved capabilities discovery encoding by formalizing the Discovery Schema as canonical reference in `capabilities.mdc`. Established authoritative JSON schema for discovery outputs, defined truncation rules, and added secrets handling guidance. Completed comparative analysis confirming no consolidation needed—Discovery section now serves as single source of truth for schema definition, eliminating duplication across ERDs.

## Impact

- **Baseline → Outcome:** Discovery schema — Informal guidance → Canonical JSON schema with enforcement rules
- **Duplication eliminated:** Schema definition — 2 locations (ERD + rule) → 1 authoritative location (`capabilities.mdc`)
- **Truncation behavior:** Undefined → "Show first 10 per source, indicate N more"
- **Secrets handling:** Implicit → Explicit guidance (never echo tokens/keys in discovery output)
- **Notes:** Low-risk documentation improvement that establishes single source of truth for future discovery implementations. Paired with platform-capabilities-generic for coordinated completion.

## Retrospective

### What worked

- **Analysis-first approach:** Comparative analysis documented overlaps/gaps before making changes
- **Schema placement decision:** Putting canonical schema in `capabilities.mdc` Discovery section (not separate rule) kept it accessible
- **ERD cleanup:** Removing duplicate schema from ERD and adding pointer reduced maintenance burden
- **Paired execution:** Coordinating with platform-capabilities-generic ensured schema reference consistency

### What to improve

- **Could add examples:** Show concrete discovery output following the schema
- **Future validation:** Consider validation script that checks discovery outputs match canonical schema
- **Cross-ERD enforcement:** Ensure future ERDs reference canonical schema instead of redefining

### Follow-ups

- Monitor for schema violations in discovery implementations
- Consider adding discovery output examples to rule
- If MCP integration expands, validate schema applies to new sources
