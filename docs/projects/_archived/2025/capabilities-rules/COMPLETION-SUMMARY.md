# Completion Summary — Capabilities Pair Projects

**Completed:** 2025-10-23  
**Projects:** capabilities-rules + platform-capabilities-generic  
**Status:** ✅ Both projects complete

## Overview

Successfully completed two related projects to improve capabilities encoding and create vendor-agnostic platform capabilities guidance.

## Project 1: capabilities-rules

**Goal:** Evaluate and improve encoding for capabilities discovery

### What Changed

1. **Formalized Discovery Schema in capabilities.mdc**

   - Added canonical JSON schema for discovery outputs
   - Defined truncation rules (show first 10, indicate "N more")
   - Added secrets handling guidance
   - Made this the authoritative reference (other ERDs should link here, not redefine)

2. **Updated ERD**

   - Removed duplicate schema definition
   - Added pointer to canonical schema location in `capabilities.mdc`

3. **Analysis Document**
   - Decision: Keep separate with clear scopes (no consolidation needed)

### Files Modified

- ✅ `.cursor/rules/capabilities.mdc` — Added Discovery Schema (canonical)
- ✅ `docs/projects/capabilities-rules/erd.md` — Points to canonical schema

### Validation

- ✅ `.cursor/scripts/rules-validate.sh` — Passed (59 files)
- ✅ Front matter validated
- ✅ Cross-references validated
- ✅ `lastReviewed: 2025-10-23`

## Project 2: platform-capabilities-generic

**Goal:** Generalize Cursor-specific capabilities rule to vendor-agnostic guidance

### What Changed

1. **Created New Generic Rule**

   - `.cursor/rules/platform-capabilities.mdc` (new)
   - Vendor-agnostic guidance for citing official docs
   - Applies to any product/platform (GitHub, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Examples for good/bad citations, uncertainty, conflicts
   - `alwaysApply: false` (attach via intent routing)

2. **Deprecated Cursor-Specific Rule**

   - `.cursor/rules/cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc` → pointer to generic rule
   - Retains Cursor-specific doc links for convenience
   - Changed `alwaysApply: true → false`
   - Added deprecation notice

3. **Updated Cross-References**
   - `capabilities.mdc` platform reference → `@platform-capabilities`
   - Archived investigation projects unchanged (historical records)

### Files Modified

- ✅ `.cursor/rules/platform-capabilities.mdc` — New generic rule
- ✅ `.cursor/rules/cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc` — Deprecated to pointer
- ✅ `.cursor/rules/capabilities.mdc` — Updated platform reference

### Validation

- ✅ `.cursor/scripts/rules-validate.sh` — Passed (59 files)
- ✅ Front matter validated (both new and deprecated rules)
- ✅ Cross-references validated
- ✅ Fixed placeholder link examples
- ✅ `lastReviewed: 2025-10-23`

## Changelog

Added to `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased":

### Added

- `platform-capabilities.mdc` (vendor-agnostic)

### Changed

- `capabilities.mdc` (formalized Discovery Schema)

### Deprecated

- `cursor-platform-capabilities.mdc` (now pointer)

## Benefits

1. **Canonical Discovery Schema**

   - Single source of truth for discovery output format
   - Other ERDs reference it instead of redefining
   - Clear truncation and secrets handling rules

2. **Vendor-Agnostic Capabilities Guidance**

   - Reusable across any product/platform
   - Clear examples for citations and uncertainty
   - Reduces duplication for future platform integrations

3. **Cleaner Architecture**
   - Generic rule for broad guidance
   - Cursor-specific pointer for convenience
   - Clear separation of concerns
