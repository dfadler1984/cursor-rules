# Final Summary — Collaboration Options

## Summary

Documented collaboration surfaces (PR templates, optional remote sync) while establishing clear `.github/` boundaries and keeping the repo as source of truth. Clarified when to use dedicated PR templates vs `docs/` placement, provided concrete examples for feature-specific templates, and documented opt-in remote sync options (Google Docs, Confluence) with explicit enablement criteria. All 4 tasks completed in a single focused session, delivering clear guidance on configuration-only boundaries and template placement patterns.

## Impact

- **Baseline → Outcome**: `.github/` boundaries — Implicit knowledge → Explicit documentation with examples
- **Template guidance**: Undefined → Clear criteria for dedicated vs generic templates
- **Remote sync options**: Undocumented → 2 providers documented with explicit opt-in patterns
- **Decision support**: Ad-hoc → Structured guidance (when to use templates, when to use docs/)
- **Notes**: Low-risk documentation project. ADR created for Gist review deferral decision. Integration with existing `github-config-only.mdc` rule.

## Retrospective

### What worked

- **Lite mode appropriate**: Simple 4-task structure matched low-complexity scope
- **Concrete examples**: PR template structure examples made guidance actionable
- **Explicit opt-in pattern**: Remote sync documentation clearly states enablement criteria and default behavior (repo as source of truth)
- **ADR for decisions**: Captured Gist review deferral as formal architecture decision
- **Cross-references**: Links from README and split-progress tracker ensure discoverability

### What to improve

- **Template completion**: final-summary.md template was created but not filled during archival workflow (discovered during audit)
- **README.md missing**: Standard project navigation file not created before archival
- **Initial scope clarity**: Remote sync documentation could have been scoped earlier to avoid late additions

### Follow-ups

- **Monitor template usage**: Track whether dedicated templates are being used or if generic template suffices
- **Re-evaluate Gist usage**: ADR specifies 2025-10-15 revisit date for Gist-based review mechanism
- **Validate remote sync need**: If external stakeholder sharing becomes common, implement sync scripts
