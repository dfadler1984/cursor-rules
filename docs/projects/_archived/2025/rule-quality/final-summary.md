# Final Summary — Rule Quality

## Summary

Streamlined the rules system by consolidating overlapping guidance, strengthening cross-linking, enforcing front matter/format standards, and adding automated validation plus routing sanity tests. Merged testing family into one rule with subsections, created `global-defaults.mdc` as single source of truth, consolidated caps files, and implemented validation scripts for front matter, links, globs, and duplication. All acceptance criteria met: rules consolidated, validation automated, routing tests passing, and capabilities index updated.

## Impact

- Baseline → Outcome: Rule count — ~25 overlapping → ~15 focused core rules with clear quick refs
- Global defaults — duplicated across files → single `global-defaults.mdc` with links
- Testing rules — 4 separate files → 1 `testing.mdc` with subsections; `testing.caps.mdc` kept
- Validation coverage — manual/ad-hoc → automated (front matter, links, globs, duplication, caps pairing)
- Routing clarity — implicit → explicit triggers with sanity tests
- Notes: Reduced duplication, improved discoverability, established sustainable maintenance cadence

## Retrospective

### What worked

- `global-defaults.mdc` eliminated repetition of consent-first, status updates, TDD gate, and citation policies
- Testing family consolidation preserved detail while improving navigation (subsections with anchors)
- Caps consolidation (keep high-value CLI/trigger-heavy caps; fold others into main rules) balanced quick access with maintainability
- Validation script caught missing fields, broken links, overly broad globs, and duplicate blocks early
- Routing sanity prompts ("Add tests …" → attach testing+tdd-first only) validated minimal attachments

### What to improve

- Monthly/quarterly review cadence needs calendar integration or automation to stay consistent
- Some cross-links could be more granular (link to specific subsection anchors)
- Caps pairing validation could check content freshness (e.g., warn if main rule changed but caps didn't)

### Follow-ups

- Establish recurring review schedule (monthly minor, quarterly major)
- Consider automated caps freshness checks (compare lastReviewed dates)
- Monitor rule attachment patterns to identify new consolidation opportunities
