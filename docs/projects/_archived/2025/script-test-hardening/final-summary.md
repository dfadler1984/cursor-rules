# Final Summary â€” Script Test Hardening

## Summary

Investigated and resolved test environment isolation issues causing env var leakage across test runs. Root cause: test runner exported vars in parent shell, causing GH_TOKEN corruption and tmp directory pollution. Solution: D6 (test isolation) via subshell isolation. Test runner now runs each test in subshell, isolating all environment changes. Eliminated need for snapshot/restore boilerplate in tests; simplified test code significantly.

## Impact

- **Test isolation**: 56 tests now run in isolated subshells
- **Env leakage**: Eliminated (GH_TOKEN no longer corrupts across tests)
- **Code simplification**: Removed snapshot/restore patterns from tests
- **D6 standard**: Subshell isolation adopted across all test infrastructure

## Retrospective

### What worked

- Root cause analysis identified runner-level issue vs test-level workarounds
- D6 subshell isolation solved problem architecturally (not with band-aids)
- Single point of control (runner) vs per-test patterns
- Tests became simpler (directly export vars, runner handles cleanup)

### What to improve

- Initial approaches (token override flags, get_env helper) attacked symptoms not cause
- D6 solution was elegant; could have identified sooner

### Follow-ups

- None; D6 standard prevents recurrence
