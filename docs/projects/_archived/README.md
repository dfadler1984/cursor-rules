# Archived Projects

Projects moved here are completed and no longer evolving. Keep links stable by:

- Placing projects under `docs/projects/_archived/<YYYY>/<project>/`
- Leaving a short redirect note or link at the original path (see template)
- Keeping the central index updated with Archived entries

Move criteria (guidance):

- No planned follow-ups; docs are final
- Links are referenced externally and should remain stable
- Size/age warrants separation from Active/Completed
