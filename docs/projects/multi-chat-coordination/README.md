# Multi-Chat Coordination System

**Status**: Planning  
**Owner**: dfadler1984  
**Created**: 2025-01-26

## Vision

Automate coordination across multiple Cursor chat sessions via a local Node.js server, enabling parallel work distribution while maintaining minimal context per worker chat.

## Problem

Manual multi-chat coordination is labor-intensive. Current approach requires engineer to:

- Manually create handoff documents between chats
- Track progress across multiple sessions
- Coordinate task assignment and completion
- Maintain context synchronization

This overhead limits productivity gains from parallelization.

## Solution

**Coordinator-Worker Pattern**:

- One coordinator chat manages project-level state and task distribution
- 3-5 worker chats execute isolated tasks with minimal context
- Local Node.js WebSocket server enables cross-chat communication
- Semi-autonomous polling pattern respects Cursor's turn-based model

**Key Innovation**: Workers poll for tasks after completion, enabling autonomous progression without breaking turn-based constraints.

## Current Phase

**Phase 2**: üöÄ **READY FOR TESTING** (WebSocket server implementation complete)

### Phase 2 Implementation Status

‚úÖ TypeScript WebSocket server (22/22 tests passing)  
‚úÖ Client library with event-driven architecture  
‚úÖ File watching for automatic report detection  
‚úÖ Push-based task assignment  
‚úÖ Coordinator rule (WebSocket-based)  
‚úÖ Worker rule (no polling needed)

**Next**: Run integration test (see [protocols/phase2-integration-test.md](./protocols/phase2-integration-test.md))

### Phase 1 Results (Completed)

‚úÖ Pattern validated: 100% automation, 5.0 context efficiency, 0.67 prompts/task  
‚úÖ See [PHASE1-COMPLETE.md](./PHASE1-COMPLETE.md) for full metrics

## Success Metrics

- **Context efficiency**: Worker chats maintain score ‚â•4 throughout execution
- **Automation rate**: ‚â•80% of task handoffs happen without engineer intervention
- **Parallel speedup**: Multi-worker execution completes eligible projects 2-3x faster than single-chat
