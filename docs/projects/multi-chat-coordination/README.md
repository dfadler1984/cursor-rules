# Multi-Chat Coordination System

**Status**: Planning  
**Owner**: dfadler1984  
**Created**: 2025-01-26

## Vision

Automate coordination across multiple Cursor chat sessions via a local Node.js server, enabling parallel work distribution while maintaining minimal context per worker chat.

## Problem

Manual multi-chat coordination is labor-intensive. Current approach requires engineer to:

- Manually create handoff documents between chats
- Track progress across multiple sessions
- Coordinate task assignment and completion
- Maintain context synchronization

This overhead limits productivity gains from parallelization.

## Solution

**Coordinator-Worker Pattern**:

- One coordinator chat manages project-level state and task distribution
- 3-5 worker chats execute isolated tasks with minimal context
- Local Node.js WebSocket server enables cross-chat communication
- Semi-autonomous polling pattern respects Cursor's turn-based model

**Key Innovation**: Workers poll for tasks after completion, enabling autonomous progression without breaking turn-based constraints.

## Project Status

**Overall**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Multi-chat coordination pattern proven effective

### Final Recommendation

**Use Phase 1 (file-based) for production** - proven, simple, effective

**Phase 2 (WebSocket) is reference only** - valuable for learning, not practical for Cursor

## Phase Results

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE & RECOMMENDED

**Metrics**: 100% automation, 5.0 context efficiency, 0.67 prompts/task  
**Status**: Production-ready, validated pattern  
**See**: [PHASE1-COMPLETE.md](./PHASE1-COMPLETE.md)

### Phase 2: ✅ VALIDATED (Partial)

**Metrics**: 5.0 context efficiency, full-context delivery working  
**Status**: Partial validation (2/3 tasks), gaps identified  
**See**: [PHASE2-FINDINGS.md](./PHASE2-FINDINGS.md)

**Key learning**: Full-context delivery works beautifully, but turn-based model limits persistent connections

## Success Metrics

- **Context efficiency**: Worker chats maintain score ≥4 throughout execution
- **Automation rate**: ≥80% of task handoffs happen without engineer intervention
- **Parallel speedup**: Multi-worker execution completes eligible projects 2-3x faster than single-chat
