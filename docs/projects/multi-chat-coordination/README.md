# Multi-Chat Coordination System

**Status**: Planning  
**Owner**: dfadler1984  
**Created**: 2025-01-26

## Vision

Automate coordination across multiple Cursor chat sessions via a local Node.js server, enabling parallel work distribution while maintaining minimal context per worker chat.

## Problem

Manual multi-chat coordination is labor-intensive. Current approach requires engineer to:

- Manually create handoff documents between chats
- Track progress across multiple sessions
- Coordinate task assignment and completion
- Maintain context synchronization

This overhead limits productivity gains from parallelization.

## Solution

**Coordinator-Worker Pattern**:

- One coordinator chat manages project-level state and task distribution
- 3-5 worker chats execute isolated tasks with minimal context
- Local Node.js WebSocket server enables cross-chat communication
- Semi-autonomous polling pattern respects Cursor's turn-based model

**Key Innovation**: Workers poll for tasks after completion, enabling autonomous progression without breaking turn-based constraints.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (File-based handoff validated)

### Phase 1 Results

✅ All 3 tasks completed autonomously  
✅ Context efficiency: 5.0 (exceeded ≥4 target)  
✅ Automation rate: 100% (0 prompts during execution)  
✅ Word counts: 136, 153, 145 (all within spec)

**Status**: Pattern validated, ready for Phase 2

**Next Phase**: WebSocket server (see [phase2-planning.md](./phase2-planning.md))

## Success Metrics

- **Context efficiency**: Worker chats maintain score ≥4 throughout execution
- **Automation rate**: ≥80% of task handoffs happen without engineer intervention
- **Parallel speedup**: Multi-worker execution completes eligible projects 2-3x faster than single-chat
