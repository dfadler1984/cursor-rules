# Phase 1 Enhancement: Coordination Scripts

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Issue Identified**: File operations in coordinator chat required per-file consent, reducing autonomy

## Problem

During Phase 1 validation, discovered:

- ❌ Coordinator needed manual file operations (move, update JSON)
- ❌ Each file operation triggered consent gate
- ❌ ~2 prompts per task even with monitoring mode

**Root cause**: Direct file manipulation instead of script-wrapped operations

## Solution

Created 3 coordination scripts to wrap file operations:

### 1. `coordination-task-assign.sh`

**Purpose**: Assign task to worker (move pending → assigned, update JSON)

**Usage**:

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination/task-assign.sh <task-id> <worker-id>
```

**What it does**:

- Moves task JSON from pending/ to assigned/
- Updates JSON: `assignedTo: "<worker-id>"`, `status: "assigned"`
- Single consent for script = handles all assignments

**Tests**: 4/4 passing

- Missing task ID (error handling)
- Missing worker ID (error handling)
- Task not found (error handling)
- Successful assignment (happy path)

---

### 2. `coordination-report-check.sh`

**Purpose**: List worker completion reports

**Usage**:

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination/report-check.sh [--format json|text]
```

**What it does**:

- Lists all `task-*-report.json` files in reports/
- Returns task IDs and worker IDs
- Supports JSON output for programmatic use

**Tests**: 5/5 passing

- No reports directory (error handling)
- Empty reports (0 reports)
- Single report found
- Multiple reports found
- JSON format output

---

### 3. `coordination-task-complete.sh`

**Purpose**: Mark task as complete (move in-progress → completed)

**Usage**:

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination/task-complete.sh <task-id>
```

**What it does**:

- Moves task JSON from in-progress/ to completed/
- Idempotent (succeeds if already complete)

**Tests**: 4/4 passing

- Missing task ID (error handling)
- Task not found (error handling)
- Successful completion (happy path)
- Already completed (idempotent)

---

## Impact

**Before scripts**:

- ~2 manual prompts per task (check reports + approve file ops)
- Consent required for each file operation

**After scripts**:

- ~1 manual prompt per task (just "check for reports")
- One-time consent for scripts (or session allowlist)
- All file operations handled internally by scripts

**Improvement**: 50% reduction in manual prompts

## Coordinator Rule Updates

Updated `.cursor/rules/coordinator-chat.mdc`:

- **Section 6 (Task Assignment)**: Now uses `coordination-task-assign.sh`
- **Section 7 (Monitoring Mode)**: Now uses all 3 scripts
- **Added note**: "Scripts eliminate consent friction"
- **Related section**: Added links to all 3 scripts

---

## Test Coverage

**All scripts have tests**:

- Error handling (missing args, not found)
- Happy path (successful operations)
- Edge cases (idempotency, JSON validation)

**Test command**:

```bash
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination-task-assign.test.sh
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination-report-check.test.sh
bash .cursor/scripts/coordination-task-complete.test.sh
```

**Results**: ✅ 13/13 tests passing

---

## Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Retest with scripts**: Run validation with updated coordinator rule
2. **Measure improvement**: Track intervention count (should be ~1 per task)
3. **Document findings**: Update `protocols/phase1-validation-protocol.md`
4. **Decision**: Proceed to Phase 2 (WebSocket server) or iterate

---

## Learning

**Key insight**: Wrapping file operations in scripts eliminates repetitive consent gates while maintaining safety. This pattern should be applied early in coordination systems, not retrofitted.

**Future phases**: Phase 2 (WebSocket server) will further reduce manual intervention by enabling push-based communication (server notifies chats), eliminating polling entirely.
