# Tasks — Slash Commands Runtime Routing

## Status

**INVESTIGATION COMPLETE** — Determined not viable due to platform constraint

## Findings

- [x] 1.0 Investigate runtime routing via slash commands
  - [x] 1.1 Test `/` prefix behavior in Cursor
  - [x] 1.2 Discover platform constraint (Cursor uses `/` for prompt templates)
  - [x] 1.3 Document findings in README.md
  - [x] 1.4 Recommend alternative approach (intent routing optimization)

## Outcome

Project closed as not viable. Slash command approach abandoned.

**Alternative pursued**: See [`routing-optimization`](../routing-optimization/) for successful intent routing improvements.
