# Root README Generator

Automates generation and validation of the repository root `README.md` to keep it current, accurate, and consistent.

## Status

**Active** — Phase 3 Complete! Moving to Phase 4 (Documentation & Polish)

**Completion**: 71% (167/234 tasks) — Nearing completion!

## Overview

The root README is the repository's main entry point, but it risks becoming stale as scripts, rules, and projects evolve. This project aims to automate generation of sections like scripts inventory, stats summary, and quick links while preserving manually curated content like workflow philosophy and setup guides.

### Goals

- Keep root README accurate with automated script inventory
- Standardize formatting and reduce manual maintenance
- Provide clear navigation to docs, rules, projects, and tools
- Surface repository health metrics

### Non-Goals

- Not replacing manual conceptual content (workflow overview, design principles)
- Not handling docs/ organization (see: `document-governance` project)
- Not generating content for rules files or project ERDs

## Phase 0 Complete! ✅

All critical decisions have been made and documented:

### ✅ Resolved Decisions (2025-10-26)

1. **Generation Strategy**: Full replacement with template

   - Single template file with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax
   - Complete consistency, no drift
   - See: `decisions/generation-strategy.md`

2. **README Structure**: 15 sections (9 auto-generated, 6 manual)

   - Auto: Health badge, rules, scripts, commands, projects, stats
   - Manual: Description, workflow, setup, changelog, security, contributing
   - See: `decisions/section-ownership.md`

3. **Priority Projects**: ERD front matter with blocker support

   - Schema: `priority: high|medium|low` + `blocked: true` + `blocker: "reason"`
   - Generator surfaces priority + blocking state separately

4. **Known Issues**: Deferred to follow-up project (carry over)

   - Future: GitHub Issues API integration
   - Not blocking MVP

5. **Scripts Section**: Full categorized list
   - Show all 38+ scripts organized by category
   - Link to `docs/scripts/README.md` for details

### ⚠️ Deferred Decision (Not Blocking)

- **Update Trigger**: Manual npm script vs CI validation vs pre-commit hook
  - Can decide during Phase 3 (Validation & CI Integration)

## Architecture (Proposed)

### High-Level Flow

```
Input Sources → Metadata Extraction → Template Rendering → Validation → Output
```

### Components

1. **Metadata Extractors**

   - `extract_script_metadata()` — Scan `.cursor/scripts/`, parse headers
   - `extract_rules_metadata()` — Scan `.cursor/rules/`, parse front matter
   - `extract_project_stats()` — Count active/archived projects
   - `extract_health_metrics()` — Read health score, test coverage

2. **Template Renderer**

   - Reads template file
   - Replaces placeholders with generated content
   - Handles conditional sections (if needed)

3. **Validators**

   - Structure validation: Required sections present
   - Freshness validation: Compare with committed README
   - Link validation: Ensure targets exist

4. **Output Writer**
   - Atomic write pattern (temp file → rename)
   - Dry-run mode outputs to stdout
   - Preserve file permissions

## Implemented Scripts ✅

- `.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.sh` — Main generator (v0.1.0)
- `.cursor/scripts/validate-root-readme.sh` — Staleness validator (v0.1.0)
- `.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.test.sh` — Test suite (33/33 tests passing)

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Generate with defaults
npm run generate:root-readme
# or directly:
./.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.sh

# Dry-run preview
./.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.sh --dry-run

# Use custom template
./.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.sh --template ./custom.md

# Validate README freshness
npm run validate:root-readme
# or directly:
./.cursor/scripts/validate-root-readme.sh

# Autofix if stale
./.cursor/scripts/validate-root-readme.sh --fix
```

## Data Sources

- `.cursor/scripts/*.sh` → Script descriptions, flags, categories
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` → Rule names, descriptions, always-apply status
- `docs/projects/` → Active/archived project counts
- `capabilities.mdc` → Canonical capabilities list
- `VERSION` → Current version
- `CHANGELOG.md` → Recent entries (for "What's New")
- Health badge: Latest CI run or `health-badge-generate.sh` output

## Troubleshooting

### README Validation Fails

**Problem**: `npm run validate:root-readme` exits with code 1 (stale)

**Solution**: README needs regeneration. Run:

```bash
npm run generate:root-readme
```

### Generation Fails with "Template not found"

**Problem**: Generator can't find template file

**Solution**: Ensure `templates/root-readme.template.md` exists. Check template path with:

```bash
./.cursor/scripts/generate-root-readme.sh --help
```

### Completion Percentages Show "N/A"

**Problem**: Project completion shows "N/A" instead of percentage

**Causes**:

- Project has no `tasks.md` file
- `tasks.md` has no task items (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`)

**Solution**: Ensure project has properly formatted `tasks.md` with task checkboxes

### Scripts/Rules Not Appearing

**Problem**: Some scripts or rules missing from generated README

**Causes**:

- Scripts: Missing `# Description:` header (falls back to filename)
- Rules: Missing `description:` in front matter (falls back to "Rule: filename")
- Scripts: `.lib*.sh` or `*.test.sh` files are intentionally excluded

**Solution**: Add proper headers/front matter or accept fallback naming

### CI Workflow Fails

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow fails on validation

**Causes**:

- README is stale and needs regeneration
- Generator script has issues

**Solution**:

1. Run locally: `npm run validate:root-readme --fix`
2. Commit the regenerated README
3. Push to trigger CI again

## Performance

**Generation Time**: ~2.0s user time (meets 2s target) ✅  
**Total Time**: ~6.7s (includes I/O overhead)

**Measured on:**

- macOS with 71 scripts, 59 rules, 79 projects
- Template rendering + 7 section generators
- Processing all metadata extraction and formatting
- Test suite completes in <1s (66 tests)
