# Engineering Requirements Document — Project lifecycle & docs hygiene (Umbrella)

Mode: Lite



## 1. Introduction/Overview

Coordinate and harden lifecycle and documentation hygiene across the repository by referencing existing projects without moving files. This umbrella project provides a single place to align goals, reduce duplication, and track cross-cutting decisions while each source project remains authoritative for its own scope.

## 2. Scope & Approach

- Reference, do not move: Source projects remain as-is and authoritative.
- Dual tracking: Track relevant work both here (for consolidation visibility) and within each source project (for local ownership).
- Derive a small set of shared decisions (checklists/validators) that individual projects can adopt.

## 3. Source Projects (authoritative references)


## 4. Goals/Objectives

- Provide a cohesive lifecycle + docs hygiene view spanning organization, workflows, README standards, and completion metadata.
- Reduce duplication and contradictions across the four source projects.
- Establish a concise validation checklist that maintainers can run.
- Maintain project-level autonomy while enabling cross-project coordination.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Reference Integration

- Each source project link must be present (ERD + tasks) and kept current.
- This ERD may define cross-cutting decisions; adoptions occur in source projects with explicit links back here.

### 5.2 Tracking & Synchronization

- When creating a unified task here, add a corresponding entry or link in the relevant source project tasks.
- Include backlinks: from source tasks to this ERD (section or task) for traceability.

### 5.3 Governance & Ownership

- Owner: rules-maintainers
- Decision notes recorded as short entries with date, scope, and impacted projects.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- This ERD exists with links to all four source projects and their tasks.
- A unified tasks file exists, describing backlinks policy and validation checklist.
- Projects index updated to include this umbrella project under Active.

## 7. Risks/Edge Cases

- Drift between unified guidance and project specifics — mitigated by explicit backlinks and minimal shared decisions.
- Over-centralization — mitigated by keeping source projects authoritative and adopting changes opt-in.

## 8. Rollout

- Comms: Link this project from the projects index once validated.
- Iteration: Start by referencing; derive unified tasks as individual projects progress.

## 9. Validation

- Manual check: all links resolve locally.
- Cross-reference check: new decisions recorded here have corresponding adoption notes in source projects.
