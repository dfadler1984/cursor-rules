# Projects

This directory contains active and completed projects in this repository.

## Overview

Each project follows a standard structure:

- **ERD** (Engineering Requirements Document) - Defines scope, goals, and requirements
- **Tasks** - Tracks implementation progress with dependencies and priorities

Projects are automatically indexed by scanning project directories (excluding `_archived/` and `_examples/`).
