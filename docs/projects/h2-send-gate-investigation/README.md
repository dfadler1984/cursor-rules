# H2: Send Gate Investigation

**Parent**: [rules-enforcement-investigation](../rules-enforcement-investigation/)  
**Status**: MONITORING  
**Created**: 2025-10-16 (split from parent)

## Overview

Investigation of whether the pre-send compliance gate in `assistant-behavior.mdc` actually executes, detects violations, and blocks them.

**Hypothesis**: Making the gate output visible will improve compliance through accountability.

---

## Key Findings

**Baseline**: 0% gate visibility (Test A - retrospective analysis of 17 operations)

**After visible output requirement**: 100% gate visibility (Test D - Checkpoint 1)

**Result**: âœ… CONFIRMED - Visible output creates accountability

## Contribution to Parent

**Primary finding**: Visible gate output increases compliance through transparency and accountability.

**Pattern identified**: Explicit OUTPUT requirements create forcing functions where silent checklists don't.

**Applied to**: `assistant-behavior.mdc` - Added explicit OUTPUT requirement to pre-send gate.

## Status

**Current Phase**: Test D monitoring (checkpoint 1 complete)  
**Next**: Continue passive monitoring over 10-20 responses  
**Expected**: Sustained 100% gate visibility, improved overall compliance
