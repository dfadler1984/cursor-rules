# Engineering Requirements Document — GitHub Workflows Utility (Lite)

Mode: Lite

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Audit and evaluate the utility of all GitHub Actions workflows used (or missing) in this repository. Identify gaps and propose/add workflows that improve maintainability, safety, and developer ergonomics while respecting repo rules (e.g., `.github/` boundaries: configuration only).

### Uncertainty / Assumptions

- Scope includes: inventory existing `.github/workflows/` (may be empty), evaluate usefulness, propose safe additions.
- Assume no secrets are committed; use repository/Org secrets as needed for CI.
- Prefer lightweight, low-maintenance actions; avoid heavy dependencies.

## 2. Goals/Objectives

- Inventory current workflows with purpose, triggers, and outputs.
- Assess each workflow’s utility vs. maintenance cost; recommend keep/tweak/remove.
- Propose additional workflows aligned with repo rules to ease project management.
- Provide draft YAMLs and rollout steps behind small, reversible changes.

## 3. User Stories

- As a maintainer, I understand what each workflow does and why it exists.
- As a contributor, I get fast feedback (lint/type/test) on PRs.
- As a release manager, I see changeset status and CI gates clearly on PRs.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. Produce a written inventory of existing workflows (or note none present).
2. For each, document: trigger(s), purpose, outcomes, maintenance considerations.
3. Propose a minimal set of new workflows with rationale and constraints.
4. Provide draft YAML for each proposed workflow, ready to PR.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- Keep YAML simple and portable; pin action versions by major tag.
- Run quickly; favor path filters to avoid unnecessary CI on docs-only changes.
- Avoid secrets where possible; prefer read-only operations for PRs from forks.

## 6. Architecture/Design

- Workflows live under `.github/workflows/` and remain configuration-only per repo policy.
- Coverage (if any) complements TDD rules; do not replace owner specs.

## 7. Data Model and Storage


## 8. Integrations/Dependencies

- GitHub-hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`).
- Node.js toolchain present in repo (`package.json`) for lint/type/test if applicable.

## 9. Edge Cases and Constraints

- PRs from forks cannot access repository secrets; design jobs accordingly.
- Long-running matrices can slow feedback; keep jobs minimal and parallel.
- Avoid modifying product docs via `.github/` per repo rule.

## 10. Testing & Acceptance

- Acceptance:
  - Inventory of existing workflows completed and documented.
  - Proposal of additions includes rationale and draft YAMLs.
  - Path filters and safety notes documented for each workflow.
  - Project is listed in `docs/projects/README.md` under Active.

## 11. Rollout & Ops

- Phase 1: Inventory + assessment → PR doc-only changes (no workflows yet).
- Phase 2: Add one low-risk CI workflow (lint/types/tests) behind path filters.
- Phase 3: Add optional validators (rules/links) after validation locally.

## 12. Success Metrics

- Faster, clearer PR feedback (time-to-signal, fewer manual checks).
- Reduced CI noise (skipped runs on docs-only changes where appropriate).
- Higher consistency in adhering to repo rules (e.g., rules validators pass).

## 13. Open Questions

- Which test/lint commands should run in CI for this repo? (confirm scripts)
- Which files should bypass CI (docs-only) vs still run validators?
- Do we want PR title checks (Conventional Commits) enforced in CI?
