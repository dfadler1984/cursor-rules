# Tasks: Assistant Self-Testing Limits

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Completion**: 0%

---

## Phase 1: Document the Paradox

- [ ] 1.0 Create `testing-paradox.md`
  - [ ] 1.1 Explain observer bias in self-testing
  - [ ] 1.2 Use slash commands experiment as concrete example
  - [ ] 1.3 Contrast valid vs invalid measurement approaches
  - [ ] 1.4 Note philosophical limitation (not solvable, work within)

## Phase 2: Define Measurement Strategies

- [ ] 2.0 Create `measurement-strategies.md`
  - [ ] 2.1 Historical analysis (retrospective compliance)
  - [ ] 2.2 Natural usage monitoring (passive accumulation)
  - [ ] 2.3 User-observed validation (spot checks, qualitative)
  - [ ] 2.4 External validation (CI, linters, hooks)
  - [ ] 2.5 When each strategy is appropriate

## Phase 3: Update Investigation

- [ ] 3.0 Update rules-enforcement-investigation
  - [ ] 3.1 Add testing paradox to findings.md (Gap #8)
  - [ ] 3.2 Update slash-commands-decision.md with deferral rationale
  - [ ] 3.3 Note measurement limitations in test plans
  - [ ] 3.4 Update tasks.md to reflect deferral

## Phase 4: Decision Framework

- [ ] 4.0 Create `experiment-design-guide.md`
  - [ ] 4.1 Decision tree: when is self-testing valid?
  - [ ] 4.2 Criteria for external validation
  - [ ] 4.3 Fallback strategies
  - [ ] 4.4 Examples from rules-enforcement-investigation

## Phase 5: Integration

- [ ] 5.0 Update related documentation
  - [ ] 5.1 Link from test-plan-template.mdc
  - [ ] 5.2 Reference in rules-enforcement-investigation README
  - [ ] 5.3 Add to projects README
  - [ ] 5.4 Create summary document

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Testing paradox clearly explained with examples
- [ ] Valid measurement strategies documented
- [ ] Rules-enforcement-investigation updated
- [ ] Decision framework provided
- [ ] Future experiments avoid invalid self-tests
