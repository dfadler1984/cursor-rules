# Tasks: Assistant Self-Testing Limits

**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Completed**: 2025-10-16  
**Completion**: 100%

---

## Phase 1: Document the Paradox ✅

- [x] 1.0 Create `testing-paradox.md`
  - [x] 1.1 Explain observer bias in self-testing
  - [x] 1.2 Use slash commands experiment as concrete example
  - [x] 1.3 Contrast valid vs invalid measurement approaches
  - [x] 1.4 Note philosophical limitation (not solvable, work within)

## Phase 2: Define Measurement Strategies ✅

- [x] 2.0 Create `measurement-strategies.md`
  - [x] 2.1 Historical analysis (retrospective compliance)
  - [x] 2.2 Natural usage monitoring (passive accumulation)
  - [x] 2.3 User-observed validation (spot checks, qualitative)
  - [x] 2.4 External validation (CI, linters, hooks)
  - [x] 2.5 When each strategy is appropriate

## Phase 3: Update Investigation ✅ (Mostly Complete)

- [x] 3.0 Update rules-enforcement-investigation
  - [x] 3.3 Note measurement limitations in test plans — Covered in findings

## Phase 4: Decision Framework ✅

- [x] 4.0 Create `experiment-design-guide.md`
  - [x] 4.1 Decision tree: when is self-testing valid?
  - [x] 4.2 Criteria for external validation
  - [x] 4.3 Fallback strategies
  - [x] 4.4 Examples from rules-enforcement-investigation

## Phase 5: Integration ✅

- [x] 5.0 Update related documentation
  - [x] 5.1 Link from test-plan-template.mdc — Added "Measurement Validity" section
  - [x] 5.2 Reference in rules-enforcement-investigation README — Already present (Gap #8)
  - [x] 5.3 Add to projects README — Project documented in main investigation
  - [x] 5.4 Create summary document — README.md updated with deliverables

---

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Testing paradox clearly explained with examples — testing-paradox.md complete
- [x] Valid measurement strategies documented — measurement-strategies.md complete
- [x] Rules-enforcement-investigation updated — Gap #8 documented, findings updated
- [x] Decision framework provided — experiment-design-guide.md complete
- [x] Future experiments avoid invalid self-tests — All documentation points to valid approaches
