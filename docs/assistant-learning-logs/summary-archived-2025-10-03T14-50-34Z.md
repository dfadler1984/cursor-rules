# Archived Assistant Learning Logs

- Timestamp: 2025-10-03T14-50-34Z
- Archived count: 11

## Highlights

- Logging stabilized and automated: added logger and redaction scripts, sourceable alias, CI self-test, and smoke test.
- Auto-learning logs enabled (consent-based) and restored after BSD sed redaction issue.
- Destination policy clarified: prefer `assistant-logs/`, explicit writability check, and annotated fallback to `docs/assistant-learning-logs/`.
- Project lifecycle codified: rule + validator added; checklist/template referenced in ERDs.
- TDD discipline reinforced with Redâ†’Green fixes captured in logs.
