## Logging Workflow

### When to Create a Log

Create a monitoring log when you observe:

- {{LOG_TRIGGER_1}}
- {{LOG_TRIGGER_2}}
- {{LOG_TRIGGER_3}}

### Log Creation Process

1. **Observe** the behavior/issue during work
2. **Check** `active-monitoring.yaml` to confirm this project monitors it
3. **OUTPUT**: `"Observed: [description] | Category: [category] | Project: [checked active-monitoring.yaml â†’ {{PROJECT_SLUG}}] | Logging to: docs/projects/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/monitoring/logs/"`
4. **Create log** using: `monitoring-log-create.sh --project {{PROJECT_SLUG}} --observation "description"`

### Log Structure

**Front matter** (auto-populated by script):

```yaml
---
logId: ###
timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC"
project: "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}"
observer: "Assistant|<name>"
reviewed: false
reviewedBy: null
reviewedDate: null
context: "<work-context>"
---
```

**Content sections**:

- **Observation**: Factual description of what happened
- **System State**: Rules loaded, gates triggered, files involved
- **Raw Data**: Timestamps, durations, error messages, commands
- **Notes**: Additional context (minimal interpretation)

---

## Finding Development

### When to Create a Finding

Create a finding when you identify:

- **Pattern** across multiple logs (2+ similar observations)
- **Root cause** analysis completed
- **Actionable recommendation** available

### Finding Creation Process

1. **Analyze** logs in `monitoring/logs/` for patterns
2. **Create finding** using: `monitoring-finding-create.sh --project {{PROJECT_SLUG}} --title "pattern-name"`
3. **Reference source logs** in front matter and evidence section
4. **Include** pattern, root cause, impact, recommendations

### Finding Structure

**Front matter** (auto-populated by script):

```yaml
---
findingId: ###
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
project: "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}"
severity: "critical|high|medium|low"
status: "open|in-progress|resolved"
reviewed: false
reviewedBy: null
reviewedDate: null
sourceLogs: ["log-###", "log-###"]
---
```

**Content sections**:

- **Pattern**: What pattern was identified
- **Evidence**: References to specific logs with key facts
- **Root Cause**: Analysis of why this happens
- **Impact**: Effect on project/quality/compliance
- **Recommendation**: Proposed actions to address
- **Related**: Links to other findings, projects, rules

---

## Review Process

### Review Schedule

- **Logs**: Review weekly, mark as reviewed after analysis
- **Findings**: Review within 30 days of creation
- **Monitoring health**: Check monthly for staleness

### Review Workflow

1. **Run review**: `monitoring-review.sh --project {{PROJECT_SLUG}}`
2. **Analyze patterns**: Look for recurring issues, trends
3. **Mark reviewed**: `monitoring-review.sh --project {{PROJECT_SLUG}} --mark-reviewed`
4. **Update findings**: Create new findings from patterns
5. **Update status**: Mark findings as in-progress or resolved

### Review Criteria

**Logs ready for review when**:

- Pattern emerges (2+ similar observations)
- Root cause identified
- Action needed

**Findings ready for review when**:

- Evidence is complete
- Recommendations are actionable
- Impact assessment is accurate

## Monitoring Configuration

### Active Monitoring Entry

**Location**: `docs/active-monitoring.yaml`

**Entry structure**:

```yaml

## Closure Criteria

### When to Close Monitoring

**Success criteria met**:

- {{SUCCESS_CRITERION_1}} achieved
- {{SUCCESS_CRITERION_2}} achieved
- No new issues in {{STALENESS_THRESHOLD}} days

**Duration completed**:

- End date reached: {{END_DATE}}
- Monitoring objectives fulfilled

**Project lifecycle**:

- Project archived â†’ monitoring closes automatically
- Project completed â†’ monitoring may continue if valuable

### Closure Process

1. **Review final state**: Run `monitoring-dashboard.sh` to verify status
2. **Update config**: Move entry from `monitoring:` to `completed:` in `active-monitoring.yaml`
3. **Archive findings**: Ensure all findings reviewed and resolved/documented
4. **Update project**: Add monitoring summary to project README
