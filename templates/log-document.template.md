# Monitoring Log {{LOG_ID}} â€” {{DESCRIPTION}}

**Observer**: {{OBSERVER}}  
**Context**: {{WORK_CONTEXT}}

## Observation

{{OBSERVATION_DESCRIPTION}}

<!--
Factual description of what happened. Keep objective and minimal interpretation.
Examples:
- Created `project-archive-ready.sh` (255 lines) without test file
- User said "implement X", guidance rules attached instead of implementation rules
- Pre-send gate did not trigger despite TDD rule loaded
-->

## System State

- **Rule(s) loaded**: {{RULES_LOADED}}
- **Gate status**: {{GATE_STATUS}}
- **Pre-send gate**: {{PRE_SEND_GATE_STATUS}}
- **Files involved**: {{FILES_INVOLVED}}

<!--
Capture the state of the system when the observation occurred:
- Which rules were attached/loaded (from intent routing)
- Did any gates trigger? (TDD pre-edit, pre-send, etc.)
- What was the gate response? (blocked, passed, warning)
- List specific files created, edited, or involved
-->

- **Error messages**: {{ERROR_MESSAGES}}
- **Command executed**: {{COMMAND_EXECUTED}}
- **Exit code**: {{EXIT_CODE}}

This is raw data collection, not analysis.
Examples:
- "This occurred 5 minutes after TDD gate was deployed"
- "Project context was rules-enforcement-investigation (ironic)"
- "User was working on archival script functionality"
- "Similar pattern observed in log-003 and log-007"
