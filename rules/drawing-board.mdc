## Process

0. Intent Routing: Parse commands (e.g., 'Could you add {thing} to the drawing board?' as /draw {thing}); proceed to step 1.
1. /draw [concept]: Prototype the concept (e.g., "/draw role-rules", "/draw engineer-prompting", "/draw jest-inference", "/draw role-tailoring-enhance", "/draw bash-script-linting", "/draw intent-router").
2. For concepts:
   - role-rules: Draft base rule, role overrides, test intent parsing.
   - engineer-prompting: Test model-initiated prompts.
   - jest-inference: Experiment with inferring `testFilePattern` and `skipRedFor` from `jest.config.js`.
   - role-tailoring-enhance: Refine role-specific advice, evaluate onboarding impact.
   - bash-script-linting: Prototype linting for `scripts/*.sh` (e.g., ShellCheck), test error detection, log outcomes.
   - intent-router: Prototype central intent router/phase enforcer to sync TDD, Git, and Spec Kit/ai-dev-tasks phases, test rule integration.
3. Log outcomes to docs/learning-<timestamp>-<name>.md via assistant-learning-log.mdc.
4. Suggest rule candidates to rule-creation.mdc.

- Vibe: "@drawing-board [concept]; evaluate."
