## Process

1. Clarify: Ask context (e.g., "For planning, coding, or MCP? Role?").
2. List:
   - Rules: Scan .mdc files (e.g., TDD: "Write failing test first", spec-driven: "Generate ERD").
   - MCP: Query active servers (e.g., GitHub: "create_commit returns commit SHA", Atlassian: "list_issues returns open tickets").
   - Local: Scan `scripts/*.sh`, parse top comment (e.g., `# Description: Builds project`) for purpose, tagged as manual.
3. Advise: Tailor to role (e.g., "Director: Lead Specify with ERD", "Manager: Plan and review tasks", "Engineer: Implement with TDD").
4. Reflect: Log queries; suggest new capabilities (e.g., "Add detective mode?").

- Vibe: "Advise on capabilities for planning."
