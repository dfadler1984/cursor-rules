Optimize intent routing with 4 key improvements

- Add explicit intent override tier (guidance/implementation patterns override file signals)
- Implement confidence-based disambiguation (High/Medium/Low with confirmation prompts)
- Add multi-intent handling (plan-first default with explicit exceptions)
- Refine triggers for top 10 intent patterns (expanded verbs, exclusions, optional targets)

Phase 2 validation: 10/10 test cases pass (100% accuracy)
Expected impact: routing accuracy 68% â†’ 88-92%
