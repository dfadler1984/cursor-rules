Complete active monitoring formalization and enforcement research

Major enhancements to monitoring system and breakthrough discoveries about platform enforcement capabilities:

- Enhanced YAML-based monitoring system replacing ad-hoc ACTIVE-MONITORING.md
- Complete migration of 34+ existing findings to structured monitoring directories
- Comprehensive monitoring script suite (log creation, finding creation, review management)
- Templates for monitoring protocol, logs, findings, and reviews
- Discovery of Cursor Rules platform limitations (guidance only, not executable constraints)
- Identification of Cursor hooks system capabilities and limitations
- External enforcement path validation (git hooks, CI, monitoring systems)

Both projects (active-monitoring-formalization and rules-enforcement-investigation) completed core research and implementation, now paused for strategic enforcement decisions.
