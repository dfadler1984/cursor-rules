feat: archive shell-and-script-tooling and 8 child projects

Complete archival of shell script infrastructure project suite (9 projects total). All objectives achieved:

- **Infrastructure complete**: D1-D6 standards implemented across 45 production scripts
- **ShellCheck integration**: Zero errors, zero warnings, CI enforced
- **Orchestrators**: 3 major scripts refactored (839 lines reduced, 48% average)
- **Focused alternatives**: 10 single-responsibility scripts created
- **Testing**: 56 tests passing, comprehensive coverage
- **Enforcement**: Unix Philosophy rule prevents future violations

Follow-up work (P3 optional refinements) moved to active `script-refinement` project.
