refactor: convert major scripts to Unix Philosophy orchestrators

Convert 3 major monolithic scripts to thin orchestrators achieving 48% average line reduction:

- **rules-validate.sh**: 497 → 301 lines (40% reduction) - delegates to 5 focused validators
- **context-efficiency-gauge.sh**: 342 → 124 lines (64% reduction) - delegates to score + format scripts
- **pr-create.sh**: deprecated with notice, recommends focused alternatives

**New script extracted:**

- `context-efficiency-format.sh` (282 lines) - formats efficiency scores in 4 modes

**Total reduction:** 414 lines removed while maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Testing:** All 56 tests passing, no regressions.

Remaining optional work (P3 priority) deferred to new `script-refinement` project.
