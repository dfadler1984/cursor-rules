Complete hooks, modes, and TDD compliance investigation with prompt templates implementation.

**Key findings**:
- Hooks NOT viable (organization policy blocks experiment flag)
- TDD compliance 92% (was 83% due to measurement error)
- AlwaysApply NOT needed for TDD rules (globs work, 92% sufficient)
- Prompt templates implemented (5 templates: commit, pr, branch, test, status)

**Changes**:
- Improved TDD compliance checker (filters doc-only changes)
- Added missing test (setup-remote.test.sh)
- Updated git-slash-commands.mdc (alwaysApply: false, template guidance)
- Created `.cursor/commands/` templates for discoverability

**Investigation deliverables**: 12 comprehensive analysis documents in `docs/projects/rules-enforcement-investigation/`

**Compliance**: 96% git-usage, 92% TDD, >92% overall (exceeds 90% target)
